<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The aim of this book is to give the materials for the inductive study of
English verse. Its origin was in certain university courses, for which
it proved to be necessary&mdash;often for use in a single hour's work&mdash;to
gather almost numberless books, some of which must ordinarily be
inaccessible except in the vicinity of large libraries. I have tried to
extract from these books the materials necessary for the study of
English verse-forms, adding notes designed to make the specimens
intelligible and useful.</p>

<p>Dealing with a subject where theories are almost as numerous as those
who have written on it, it has been my purpose to avoid the setting
forth of my own opinions, and to present the subject-matter in a way
suited, so far as possible, to the use of those holding widely divergent
views. In the arrangement and naming of the earlier sections of the
book, some systematic theory of the subject&mdash;accepted at least
tentatively&mdash;was indeed indispensable; but I trust that even here those
who would apply to English verse a different classification or
terminology may be able to discard what they cannot approve and to make
use of the specimens from their own standpoint. Even where (as in these
introductory sections) the notes seem to overtop the text somewhat
threateningly, they are invariably intended&mdash;as the type indicates&mdash;to
be subordinate. Where it has been possible to do so, I have preferred to
present comments on the specimens in the words of other writers, and
have not confined these notes to opinions with which I wholly agree, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>only to those which seem worthy of attention. My own views on the more
disputed elements of the subject (such as the relations of time and
accent in our verse, the presence of "quantity" in English, and the
terminology of the subject) I have reserved for Part Three, where I
trust they will be found helpful by some readers, but where they may
easily be passed over.</p>

<p>To classify the materials of this subject is peculiarly difficult, and
one who tries to solve the problem will early abandon the hope of being
able to follow any system with consistency. Main divisions and
subdivisions will inevitably conflict and overlap. For practical
purposes, basing my arrangement in part on that found convenient in
university lectures (which it will be seen is not altogether unlike that
followed by Schipper in his <i>Englische Metrik</i>), I have divided the
specimens of verse into two main divisions, each of which is suggested
by a word in the sub-title of the book. Part One contains specimens
designed to illustrate the principles of English verse, arranged in
topical order. Part Two contains specimens designed to illustrate the
history of the more important forms of English verse, arranged&mdash;in the
several divisions&mdash;in chronological order. Part Three has already been
spoken of. Part Four contains extracts from important critical writers
on the place and function of the verse-element in poetry,&mdash;matters which
give us the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for the whole study of versification.</p>

<p>If there had ever been hope of making the collection of specimens fairly
complete, even in a representative sense, this would have been
dissipated by the discovery, during the very time of the book's going
through the press, of a number of additional specimens which it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> seemed
wicked to omit. Doubtless every reader will miss some favorite selection
which might well have been included, and suggestions as to important
omissions will be received gratefully. The attempt has been to put
students on the track of all the more important lines of development of
English verse, and to indicate, by including a considerable number of
specimens from early periods, the continuity of this development from
the times of our Saxon forefathers to our own.</p>

<p>Little consistency can be claimed for the practice observed in the
matter of modernizing texts that date from transition periods like the
sixteenth century. In some cases the text has been modernized, or
retained in its original form, according as it seemed well to emphasize
either the permanent significance or the historical position of the
specimen in question. In other cases the form of the text was determined
merely by the best edition accessible for purposes of reproduction.</p>

<p>Dates have been appended to the specimens in those sections where
chronology is a significant element. It has not always been possible to
verify these dates with thoroughness, or to distinguish between the date
of writing and that of publication; but it is hoped that inaccuracies of
this sort will at least not be found of a character to misrepresent the
historical relations of the specimens. Dates are not ordinarily given
for the poems of writers still living.</p>

<p>In the notes on the specimens I have tried to distinguish between
material likely to be useful for all students of the subject and that
going more into detail, which is intended only for advanced or special
students. Notes of the second class are printed in smaller type. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
has been no attempt to give the notes of a bibliographical character any
pretension to completeness. One may well hesitate to add, in this
direction, to the admirable material presented in the <i>Methods and
Materials of Literary Criticism</i> of Professors Gayley and Scott.</p>

<p>I have resisted strenuously all temptation to choose or to annotate
specimens on general grounds of &aelig;sthetic enjoyment, apart from the
distinct study of verse-forms. Yet it would be useless to deny having
sometimes made choice of particular verses, all other considerations
being equal, for their poetic or literary value over and above their
prosodical. I shall not claim for the collection what Boswell did for
Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, that "he was so attentive in the choice" of
the illustrative passages "that one may read page after page ... with
improvement and pleasure;" yet I may say that, so far from fearing that
the enjoyment of any poem will be injured by a proper attention to the
elements of its metrical form, it is my hope that many a haunting verse
may linger, a perpetual possession of beauty, in the memory of the
student who first found it here classified under a technical name.</p>

<p>Many obligations are to be acknowledged to scholars of whose advice I
have availed myself. Most kindly aid has been received from Professor G.
L. Kittredge and Dr. Fred N. Robinson, of Harvard University; from
Professor Felix E. Schelling, of the University of Pennsylvania; from my
friend, Mr. H. P. Earle, of Stanford University; and from my colleague,
Dr. Ewald Fl&uuml;gel. My obligation to Schipper's monumental works on
English verse will be obvious to every scholar. They suggested many of
the specimens of verse-forms, and are also represented by translations
or paraphrases in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> notes; references to Schipper, without full
title, are to the <i>Englische Metrik</i>,&mdash;the larger work. I have also made
thankful use of Mr. John Addington Symonds's essays on Blank Verse, and
of Professor Corson's <i>Primer of English Verse</i>,&mdash;both somewhat
unscientific but highly suggestive works. The section on Artificial
French Forms obviously owes very much to Mr. Gleeson White's <i>Ballades
and Rondeaus</i>. A book to which my obligation is out of all proportion to
the number of actual quotations from it is Mr. J. B. Mayor's <i>Chapters
on English Metre</i>. This modest but satisfying volume seemed to me, when
I first was taking up the study of English verse, to be a grateful
relief from the thorny and often fruitless discussions with which the
subject had been overgrown; and in returning to it again and again, I
have never failed to renew the impression. Its suggestions underlie a
good part of the system of classification and terminology adopted for
this book. The new and enlarged edition came to hand too late for use,
but I was able to include references to it in the notes.</p>

<p>I must also record thanks to those authors and publishers who have
courteously given permission for the reproduction of their publications:
to Mr. John Lane, for permission to quote from the works of Mr. William
Watson and Mr. Stephen Phillips; to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin and
Company, for permission to make extracts from the poems of Mr. William
Vaughn Moody and from Mr. Stedman's <i>Nature and Elements of Poetry</i>; to
Macmillan and Company, Limited, of London, for permission to make
extracts from Professor Butcher's <i>Aristotle's Theory of Poetry</i> and
from Mr. Courthope's <i>Life in Poetry and Law in Taste</i>; to Professor F.
B. Gummere and The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> Macmillan Company of New York, for permission to
quote from the former's <i>Beginnings of Poetry</i>; to the Lothrop
Publishing Company of Boston, for permission to reprint Mr. Clinton
Scollard's villanelle, "Spring Knocks at Winter's Frosty Door," from the
volume entitled <i>With Reed and Lyre</i>; to Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman,
for permission to reprint her rondeau, "A Man must Live," from the
volume entitled <i>On This Our World</i> (published by Small, Maynard and
Company); to Dr. Samuel Minturn Peck, for permission to reprint one of
the triolets called "Under the Rose," from his volume entitled <i>Cap and
Bells</i>; to the Frederick A. Stokes Company, for permission to reprint
Mr. Frank D. Sherman's "Ballade to Austin Dobson," from the volume
entitled <i>Madrigals and Catches</i>. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, Mr. W. E.
Henley, and Mr. Edmund Gosse have given generous permission to quote
freely from their poems. Mr. Henley was also good enough to suggest the
choice of the rondeau from his "Bric-&agrave;-Brac"; and Mr. Gosse, whose
unfailing courtesy follows up his numerous published aids to students of
English poetry, has also added some personal notes on the history of the
heroic couplet.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be said that a considerable part of the studies
resulting in this book was carried on while the editor held the Senior
Fellowship in English on the Harrison Foundation in the University of
Pennsylvania. If, therefore, the book should prove of service to any,
the fact will be a single additional tribute to the munificence of that
foundation.</p>

<h1>ENGLISH VERSE</h1>

<h3>I. ACCENT AND TIME</h3>

<h4>A.&mdash;KINDS OF ACCENT</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> accents of English syllables as appearing in verse are commonly
classified in two ways: according to degree of intensity, and according
to cause or significance.</p>

<p>Obviously there can be no fixed limits to the number of degrees of
intensity recognized in syllabic accent or stress. It is common to speak
of three such degrees: syllables having accent (stressed), syllables
having secondary accent, and syllables without accent (unstressed).
Schipper makes four groups: Principal Accent (<i>Hauptaccent</i> or
<i>Hochton</i>), Secondary Accent (<i>Nebenaccent</i> or <i>Tiefton</i>), No Accent
(<i>Tonlosigkeit</i>), and Disappearance of Sound (<i>Stummheit</i>). In
illustration he gives the word <i>ponderous</i>, where the first syllable has
the chief accent, the last a secondary accent, the second no accent;
while in the verse</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Most ponderous and substantial things"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the second syllable is suppressed or silent.</p>

<p>Mr. A. J. Ellis, in like manner, recognized three principal classes of
syllables: those stressed in the first degree, those stressed in the
second degree, and those unstressed.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the following lines from
<i>Paradise Lost</i> he indicated these three degrees, as he recognized them,
by the figures 2, 1, 0, written underneath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>It is worthy of note that the secondary accent seems originally to have
been a more important factor in English verse than it is commonly
considered to be in modern periods. In Anglo-Saxon verse the combination
of a primary stress, a secondary stress, and an unstressed syllable, is
a recognized type. In modern verse the reader is likely to make an
effort to reduce all syllables to the type of either stress or
no-stress. In such a verse as the following, however (from Matthew
Arnold's <i>Forsaken Merman</i>),&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And I lose my poor soul, Merman, here with thee,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we may find such a combination as that just referred to as familiar in
Anglo-Saxon rhythm. The syllables "<i>soul, Merman</i>" are respectively
cases of primary stress, secondary stress, and no-stress. On this matter
see further the remark of Luick, cited on p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_156">156</a>, below.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The element of Pitch is not ordinarily included in the treatment of
versification, as it is not ordinarily recognized as having any
significance peculiar to verse. According to Professor J. W.
Bright, however, there is such a thing as a "pitch-accent" which
plays an important part in verse where the word-accent conflicts
with that of the regular metre. Under certain exigencies, he says,
"<i>un-governed, pre-cisely, re-markable,</i> and <i>Je-rusalem</i> ... are
naturally pronounced with a pitch-accent upon the first syllables,
and with the undisturbed expiratory word-accent upon the second. It
will of course be understood that when the word-accent is defined
as expiratory this term does not exclude the inherent pitch of
English stress. Force, quantity, and pitch are combined in our
word-stress (or word-accent), both primary and secondary; but in
the secondary stress used as ictus there is a noticeable change in
the proportions of these elements, the pitch being relatively
increased. An answer is thus won for the question: How do we
naturally pronounce two stresses in juxtaposition on the same word,
or on adjacent words closely joined grammatically? This is fur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ther
illustrated in the specially emphasized words of such expressions
as 'The idea!'" where Professor Bright marks the pitch-accent on
the first syllable of "idea," retaining the stress-accent on the
second syllable. In the line</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he marks a pitch-accent where the word-stress and metrical stress
are in conflict, that is, on the syllables "dis-" and "and." "The
rhythmic use of 'disobedience,'" he says, "illustrates with its
four syllables (as here used) as many recognizable varieties of
stress. The first syllable has a secondary word-accent, raised to a
pitch-accent for ictus; the second is wholly unaccented; the third
has the chief word-accent, employed as ictus (the accent of the
preceding word, "first," is subordinate to the rhythm); the fourth
has a secondary word-accent which remains unchanged in the thesis."
The conclusion is that "ictus in conflict requires a pitch-accent."
(All these quotations are from an article on 'Proper Names in Old
English Verse,' in the <i>Publications of the Modern Language
Association</i>, n.s. vol. vii. No. 3). Professor Bright's theory of
pitch-accent is a part of his general theory of opposition to what
he calls the "sense-doctrine" of the reading of verse,&mdash;that is,
the accepted doctrine that the word and sentence accents must
ordinarily take precedence of the metrical accent.</p></div>

<p>According to cause or significance, accents are commonly classed in
three groups: Etymological or Word Accent, Syntactical or Rhetorical
Accent, and Metrical Accent. Accents of the first class are due to the
original stress of the syllable in English speech; those of the second
class are due to the importance of the syllable in the sentence; those
of the third class are due to the place of the syllable in the metrical
scheme. In the verse</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Mary had a little lamb,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the first syllable may be said to be stressed primarily for etymological
reasons, the seventh primarily for syntactical or rhetorical reasons,
and the third (which would not be accented in prose) for metrical
reasons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The general law of English verse is that only those syllables which bear
the accent of the first class (that is, which are stressed in common
speech), together with monosyllables which on occasion are stressed in
common speech, shall be placed so as to receive the metrical stress; and
that, if the word-stress and the metrical stress apparently conflict,
the metrical stress must yield. Less generally, the rhetorical or
syntactical accent in the same way takes precedence of the metrical. In
both cases exceptions are of course numerous.</p>

normal prose-accent and the normal verse-accent, where&mdash;as commonly

<p>On the other hand, we find verses showing a conflict between
prose and verse accent, where the verse-accent may be regarded
as triumphing wholly or in part. Where this triumph is complete,
the accent is said to be <i>wrenched</i>; as, for example, in old

<p>These wrenched accents are characteristic of one phase of the so-called
"pre-Raphaelite" poetry of the Victorian period; in part, no doubt, they
are due to the influence of the old ballads. My colleague Professor
Newcomer has suggested that they are partly due, also, to a dislike for
the combative accent which would occur where two heavy syllables came
together (accented as commonly) in a compound like "harp-player."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of special interest are the examples of wrenched and hovering accent
found in the verse of Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey,&mdash;more
especially in Wyatt. These mark the time when the syllable-counting
principle was coming into prominence in English verse, under the new
culture of the days of Henry VIII. The first conscious followers of this
principle seem to have given it such prominence that a verse seemed good
to them if it contained the requisite number of syllables, whether the
accents conformed to any regular system or not. In the case of Wyatt we
can also compare the original forms of many of his poems, as preserved
in manuscript, with the revised forms as printed in Tottel's Miscellany
(1557). (See Dr. Fl&uuml;gel's transcriptions from the Wyatt Mss., in
<i>Anglia</i>, vol. xviii.) The following is the octave of one of the
sonnets, as found in the Ms.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>It appears that this revision was the work of the editor, who had a
better sense of true English rhythm than the poet himself. Alscher,
however, in his work on Wyatt, contends that Wyatt doubtless revised his
own verses so as to give them their finished form. (See <i>Sir Thomas
Wyatt und Seine Stellung</i>, etc., p. 49.) Other lines in Wyatt's verse
where the number of syllables is counted but where the accents are
faulty, are these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The long love that in my thought I harbour."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And there campeth displaying his banner."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And there him hideth and not appeareth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"For good is the life, ending faithfully."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another large group of hovering accents is that formed by French words
with such terminations as <i>-our</i>, <i>-ance</i>, <i>-ace</i>, <i>-age</i>, <i>-ant</i>,
<i>-ess</i>. In such cases the original tendency of the word was to accent
the final syllable; but the general tendency of English accents being
recessive, the words often passed through a transitional period when the
accent was variable or "hovering." The first of the four lines just
quoted shows us a word of this character.</p>

<p>For an interesting presentation of certain phases of the laws of stress
in English verse, see Robert Bridges's <i>Milton's Prosody</i> (ed. 1901),
Appendix J, "on the Rules of Stress Rhythms."</p></div>


<h4>B.&mdash;TIME-INTERVALS</h4>

<p>The fundamental principle of the rhythm of English verse (and indeed of
any rhythm) is that <i>the accents appear at regular time-intervals</i>. In
practice there is of course great freedom in departing from this
regularity, the equal time-intervals being at times only a standard of
rhythm to which the varying successions of accented and unaccented
syllables are mentally referred. Where the equal time-intervals are
observed with substantial regularity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> two sorts of verse are still to
be clearly distinguished: that in which not only the intervals of time
but the numbers of syllables between the accents are substantially equal
and regular, and that in which the number of syllables varies. The
latter class is that of the native Germanic metres; the former is that
of the Romance metres, and of modern English verse as influenced by
them. With the development of regularity in the counting of syllables
there has perhaps also taken place a development of regularity in the
regular counting of the time-intervals. In other words, the modern
English reader, where the number of syllables between accents is
variable, makes the time-intervals as nearly equal as possible by
lengthening and shortening the syllables in the manner permitted by the
freedom of English speech; in early English verse, where the number of
syllables between accents varied very greatly, we cannot be sure that
the time-intervals were so accurately felt or preserved in recitation.</p>

<p>In his Preface to this poem Coleridge said: "The metre of the
<i>Christabel</i> is not, properly speaking, irregular, though it may seem so
from its being founded on a new principle; namely, that of counting in
each line the accents, not the syllables. Though the latter may vary
from seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents will be found to be
only four. Nevertheless this occasional variation in number of syllables
is not introduced wantonly, or for the mere ends of convenience, but in
correspondence with some transition, in the nature of the imagery or
passion." The verse is accurately described, but it has frequently been
pointed out as curious that Coleridge should have spoken of it as
"founded on a new principle," when the principle in question was that of
native English verse from the earliest times.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Most English verses of more than eight syllables are divided not only
into the time-intervals between the accents, but also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> into two parts
(which Schipper calls "rhythmical series") by the <i>Cesura</i>. The Cesura
is a pause not counted out of the regular time of the rhythm, but
corresponding to the pauses between "phrases" in music, and nearly
always coinciding with syntactical or rhetorical divisions of the
sentence.</p>

<p>The medial cesura is the typical pause of this kind, dividing the verse
into two parts of approximately equal length. In much early English
verse, and in French verse, this medial cesura is almost universal; in
modern English verse (and in that of some early poets, notably Chaucer)
there is great freedom in the placing of the cesura, and also in
omitting it altogether. The importance of this matter in the history of
English decasyllabic verse will appear in Part Two.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the early Elizabethan period the impression was still general that
there should be a regular medial cesura. Spenser seems to have been the
first to imitate the greater freedom of Chaucer in this regard. See the
Latin dissertation on Spenser's verse of E. Legouis (<i>Quomodo E.
Spenserus</i>, etc., Paris, 1896), and the summary of its results by Mr.
J. B. Fletcher in <i>Modern Language Notes</i> for November, 1898. "Spenser,"
says Mr. Fletcher, "revived for 'heroic verse' the neglected variety in
unity of his self-acknowledged master, Chaucer." In Gascoigne's <i>Notes
of Instruction concerning the making of verse or ryme in English</i>
(1575), we find: "There are also certayne pauses or restes in a verse
whiche may be called Ceasures.... In mine opinion in a verse of eight
sillables, the pause will stand best in the middest, in a verse of tenne
it will be placed at the ende of the first foure sillables; in a verse
of twelve, in the midst.... In Rithme royall, it is at the wryters
discretion, and forceth not where the pause be untill the ende of the
line." This greater liberty allowed the rime royal is doubtless due to
the influence of Chaucer on that form. For Gascoigne's practice in
printing his verse with medial cesura, even without regard to rhetorical
divisions, see the specimen given below.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Another interesting Elizabethan account of the cesura is found in
Puttenham's <i>Arte of English Poesie</i> (1589), where the writer compares
the verse-pause to a stop made by a traveler at an inn for rest and
refreshment. (Arber's Reprint, p. 88.)</p></div>

<p>For specimens of regular medial cesura, and of variable cesura, in
modern verse, see under the Decasyllabic Couplet and Blank Verse, in
Part Two.</p>

<p>The Cesura is called <i>masculine</i> when it follows an accented syllable.
(For examples, see previous specimen from Gascoigne.) It is called
<i>feminine</i> when it follows an unaccented syllable. Two varieties of the
feminine cesura are also distinguished: the Lyric, when the pause occurs
inside a foot; <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"This wicked traitor, whom I thus accuse;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the Epic, when the pause occurs after an extra (hypermetrical) light
syllable; <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"To Canterbury with ful devout corage."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "epic" cesura is quite as characteristic of dramatic blank verse as
of epic.</p>

<p>The pause occurring at the end of a line is equally regular with the
medial pause, and corresponds in the same way to a phrase-pause in
music. It is an element of the same character, then, as the cesura,
though not bearing the same name. It coincides less closely than the
cesura with syntactical and rhetorical pauses. When there is no
corresponding syntactical or rhetorical pause at the end of the line (in
other words, when the metrical pause marking the end of the verse cannot
be prominently represented in reading without interfering with the
expression of the sense), the line is said to be "run-on." Such an
ending is also called <i>enjambement</i>. The importance of this distinction
between "end-stopped" and "run-on" lines will appear in the notes on the
Decasyllabic Couplet and Blank Verse, in Part Two.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Pauses filling the time of syllables.</p>

<p>A second class of silent time-intervals, or pauses, is to be
distinguished from the cesural pause by the fact that in this case the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
time of the pause is counted in the metrical scheme. Pauses of this
class correspond to rests in music; and as in the case of such rests,
their occurrence is exceptional.</p>

<p>This omission of the first light syllable is characteristic of Chaucer's
couplet and of Middle English verse generally. (See Schipper, vol. i. p.

<p>These specimens of pauses in Shakspere's verse indicate the natural
varieties of dramatic form. In such cases the pause often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> occurs
between speeches, or where some action is to be understood as filling
the time; as in the second instance, where the accolade is given in the
middle of the line. (See Abbott's <i>Shakespearian Grammar</i>, pp. 413 ff.)</p>

<p>This is an instance of a pause forming a regular part of the
verse-rhythm. Thus in the first verse of each stanza the second and
sixth syllables are omitted, and the result gives the characteristic
effect of the rhythm. In measures where there is regular catalexis (that
is, where the last light syllable of the verse is regularly omitted) the
phenomenon is really of the same kind.</p>

<p>In this specimen no attempt has been made to indicate the pauses, as
different readers would interpret the verse variously. It will be found

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> According to a more elaborate system Mr. Ellis recognized
nine varieties of force or stress, which he named in order as follows:
subweak, weak, superweak, submean, mean, supermean, substrong, strong,
superstrong. In like manner he named nine degrees each of length, pitch,
weight, and silence. Length and Silence are both terms of duration of
time. The meaning of Weight has not been generally understood, nor is
the term ordinarily recognized. Mr. Ellis described it as "due to
expression and mental conceptions of importance, resulting partly from
expression in delivery, produced by quality of tone and gliding pitch,
and partly from the mental effect of the constructional predominance of
conceptions." On this whole scheme of Mr. Ellis's, Mr. Mayor remarks
interestingly: "Whilst I admire, I with difficulty repress a shudder at
the elaborate apparatus he has provided for registering the minutest
variations of metrical stress. Not only does he distinguish nine
different degrees of force, but there are the same number of degrees of
length, pitch, silence, and weight, making altogether forty-five
varieties of stress at the disposal of the metrist ... If the analysis
of rhythm is so terribly complicated, let us rush into the arms of the
intuitivists and trust to our ears only, for life is not long enough to
admit of characterizing lines when there are forty-five expressions for
each syllable to be considered." (<i>Chapters on English Metre</i>, p. 69.)</p></div>

<h3>II. THE FOOT AND THE VERSE</h3>


<p>English verse is commonly measured by feet, a determinate number of
which go to form a verse or line. The foot is determined by the distance
from one accented syllable to another in the regular scheme of the
metre. The usual metrical feet are either dissyllabic or trisyllabic.
The dissyllabic foot is commonly called an <i>iambus</i> (or <i>iamb</i>) if the
unaccented syllable precedes the accented, and a <i>trochee</i> if the
accented precedes the unaccented. The trisyllabic foot is commonly
called an <i>anapest</i> if the two unaccented syllables precede the accented
syllable, and a <i>dactyl</i> if they follow the accented syllable.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It
will be observed that the fundamental rhythm of both iambic and trochaic
verse is the same, as is also that of both anapestic and dactylic verse;
the distinction belonging only to the metre as measured into regular
lines. Iambic and anapestic verse (in which the light syllables commonly
open the verse) are sometimes called "ascending rhythm"; trochaic and
dactylic verse (in which the accented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> syllables commonly open the
verse) "descending rhythm." Ascending rhythm is very greatly in
predominance in English poetry.</p>

<p>The normal verse of any poem is therefore described by indicating the
name of the foot and the number of feet in the verse. The number of feet
is always indicated by the number of stresses or principal accents in
the normal verse. As the light or unaccented syllables may vary from the
typical number, it may also be necessary to indicate that the line is
longer than its name would imply, by reason of Feminine Ending (a light
syllable added at the end) or Anacrusis (a light syllable prefixed); or
that it is shorter than its name would indicate by reason of Catalexis
or Truncation (the light syllable at the end&mdash;or less frequently at the
beginning&mdash;being omitted).</p>

<p>In like manner, any particular verse or line is fully described by
indicating: (1) the typical foot; (2) the number of feet; (3) the place
of the cesura; (4) the presence or absence of a final pause
("end-stopped" or "run-on"); (5) the presence of such irregularities as</p>

<p>These specimens, as is usual in anapestic verse, show considerable
freedom in the treatment of the part of the foot containing the light
syllables, substituted iambi being very common. Note the iambi in the
Shelley stanza, line 1, second foot, and line 5, first foot. In the
latter case, however, the first light syllable of line 5 is really
supplied by the syllable added to make the feminine ending of line 4. In
like manner, in the Scott stanza, the first syllable of line 8 is really
supplied by the <i>-ing</i> of line 7; and where we have both feminine ending
(in line 1) and a full anapest following, the effect is that of a
hypermetrical syllable which must be hurried over in the reading. In the
specimen from Browning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> we find an iambus in the opening foot in lines 2
and 6 (also, of course, in lines 1 and 5).</p>

(except in the opening lines of the Tennyson stanza) more like a Cretic

<p>Of this translation Mr. Swinburne says that it was undertaken from a
consideration of the fact that the "marvellous metrical invention of the
anapestic heptameter was almost exactly reproducible in a language to
which all variations and combinations of anapestic, iambic, or trochaic
metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and spondaic forms of
verse are unnatural and abhorrent." ... "I have not attempted," he says
further, "the impossible and undesirable task of reproducing the rare
excep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>tional effect of a line overcharged on purpose with a
preponderance of heavy-footed spondees.... My main desire ... was to
renew as far as possible for English ears the music of this resonant and
triumphant metre, which goes ringing at full gallop as of horses who</p>

four accents, the distinction between four-stress and eight-stress verse

<p>In both these specimens the full accent regularly recurs in only the
alternate feet. Thus while the first specimen is technically
eight-stress trochaic, there are in the normal reading of it only four
full accents to the line. In other words the first, third, fifth, and
seventh feet are regularly pyrrhics. (See p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_55">55</a>.) The same thing appears
in the specimen from Kipling: <i>ye</i>, <i>and</i>, <i>in</i> (in line 2) are accented
only in a distinctly secondary fashion. Some have suggested, for such
rhythms as these, the recognition of a foot made up of one stressed and
three unstressed syllables. Lanier represents such measures (in <i>The

<h5>ii. <i>Verses in which individual feet are altered from the metrical
scheme.</i></h5>

<p>Even in metre exhibiting no marked irregularities, it is of course
rather exceptional than otherwise to find all the feet in a verse
conforming to the type-foot of the metre. Departures from the typical
metre may be conveniently classified in five groups: Deficiency in
accent; excess of accent; inversion of accent; light syllable added to
dissyllabic foot; light syllable omitted in trisyllabic foot.</p>

<p>Deficiency of accent is the most common of all the variations, if we
understand by "accent" such syllabic stress as would be ordinarily
appreciable in the reading of the word in question. It would be safe to
say that in English five-stress iambic verse, read with only the
ordinary etymological and rhetorical accents, twenty-five per cent of
the verses lack the full five stresses characteristic of the type. In
many cases, too, a foot with deficiency in stress is compensated for by
another foot in the same verse showing excess of stress. Feet thus
deficient in stress may conveniently be called <i>pyrrhics</i>, the pyrrhic
being understood as made up of two unstressed syllables. This term has
never become fully domesticated in English prosody, and some object to
its use on the ground that we have no feet wholly without stress. Its
use in the sense just indicated, however, seems to be an unquestionable
convenience.</p>

<p>Excess of accent, while less common than deficiency of accent, is even
more easily recognizable. The foot containing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> two stressed syllables,
even though one of the stresses may be distinctly stronger than the
other, may conveniently be called a <i>spondee</i>.</p>

<p>Inversion of accent is exceedingly familiar, especially at the beginning
of the verse and after the medial pause. It consists, technically
speaking, in the substitution of a trochee for an iambus or an iambus
for a trochee (the latter very rarely).</p>

<p>A light syllable inserted in dissyllabic measure is not unusual, though
by no means so common as the variations previously enumerated. Such a
syllable is frequently spoken of as "hypermetrical"; or, the variation
may be considered as the substitution of an anapest for an iambus, in
iambic measure, or the substitution of a dactyl for a trochee, in
trochaic measure.</p>

<p>The omission of one of the two light syllables from the foot in
trisyllabic verse is so common as to make it difficult to find pure
anapestic or dactylic verse in English. This fact is due in part to
preference for dissyllabic measures, and in part to the usual
indifference, in all Germanic verse, to accuracy in the number of light
syllables. The variation may frequently be regarded as involving a
prolongation of the light syllable of the foot, or a pause equal to the
time of the omitted syllable; technically speaking, it consists in the
substitution of an iambus for an anapest, or a trochee for a dactyl.</p>

<p>Examples of all these variations may best be found in the specimens of
verse included in the preceding pages. A few specimens of detail are
added here, for the sake of greater clearness.</p>

<p>A distinction should be made between these hypermetrical syllables which
change the character of the foot from dissyllabic to trisyllabic, and
syllables (in a sense hypermetrical) which are slurred or elided in the
reading. The word <i>radiance</i>, for example, is regarded as trisyllabic in
prose, but in the verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Girt with omnipotence, with radiance crowned,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it is made dissyllabic by instinctive compression, and in no proper
sense makes an anapest of the fifth foot. Of the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> character are the
numerous cases where a vowel is elided before another vowel&mdash;especially
the vowel of the article <i>the</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> On the elisions of Milton's verse,

<p>Mr. Mayor considers the question as to how far substitution of other
than the typical foot may be carried in a verse, without destroying the
genuineness of the fundamental rhythm. His conclusions are these:</p>

<p>(1) The limit of trochaic substitution is three feet out of five, with
the final foot iambic; or two out of five, if the fifth foot is

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>Professor Corson discusses the &aelig;sthetic effect of these changes from the
typical metre: "The true metrical artist ... never indulges in variety
for variety's sake.... All metrical effects are to a great extent
<i>relative</i>&mdash;and relativity of effect depends, of course, upon having a
standard in the mind or feelings.... Now the more closely the poet
adheres to his standard&mdash;to the even tenor (modulus) of his verse&mdash;so
long as there is no logical nor &aelig;sthetic motive for departing from it,
the more effective do his departures become when they are sufficiently
motived. All non-significant departures weaken the significant ones....
The normal tenor of the verse is presumed to represent the normal tenor
of the feeling which produces it. And departures from that normal tenor
represent, or should represent, variations in the normal tenor of the
feeling. Outside of the general law ... of the slurring or suppression
of extra light syllables, which do not go for anything in the
expression, an exceptional foot must result in emphasis, whether
intended or not, either logical or emotional.... A great poet is
presumed to have metrical skill; and where ripples occur in the stream
of his verse, they will generally be found to justify themselves as
organic; <i>i.e.</i> they are a part of the expression."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The names of the several kinds of feet are of course
borrowed from classical prosody, where they are used to mark feet made
up not of accented and unaccented, but of long and short syllables. The
different significance of the terms as applied to the verse of different
languages has given rise to some confusion, and it is proposed by some
to abandon the classical terms; their use, however, seems to be too well
established in English to permit of change. Some would even abandon the
attempt to measure English verse by feet, contending that its rhythm is
too free to admit of any such measuring process; thus, see Mr. J. M.
Robertson, in the Appendix to <i>New Essays toward a Critical Method</i>, and
Mr. J. A. Symonds in his <i>Blank Verse</i>. See also in Mr. Robert Bridges's
<i>Milton's Prosody</i>, Appendix G "On the Use of Greek Terminology in
English Prosody." (1901 ed. p. 77.)</p></div>

<h3><a name="III_THE_STANZA" id="III_THE_STANZA"></a>III. THE STANZA</h3>


<p>The stanza, or strophe, is the largest unit of verse-measure ordinarily
recognized. It is based not so much on rhythmical divisions as on
periods either rhetorical or melodic; that is, a short stanza will
roughly correspond to the period of a sentence, and a long one to that
of a paragraph, while in lyrical verse the original idea was to conform
the stanza to the melody for which it was written. Thus Schipper
observes: "The word strophe properly signifies a <i>turning</i>, and
originally indicated the return of the song, as sung, to the melody with
which it began." Schipper defines a stanza as a group of verses of a
certain number, so combined that all the stanzas of the same poem will
be identical in the number, the length, and the metre of the
corresponding verses; in rimed verse, also, the arrangement of the rimes
will be identical. (See <i>Grundriss</i>, p. 268.)</p>

<p>The form of a stanza, then, is determined and described (the fundamental
metre being assumed) by the number of verses, the length of verses, and
the arrangement of rimes. The usual and convenient method of indicating
these conditions is to represent all the verses that rime together by
the same letter, while the number of feet in the verse is written like
an algebraic exponent. Thus a quatrain in "common metre" (four-stress
and three-stress lines), riming alternately, is represented by the
formula <i>a<sup>4</sup>b<sup>3</sup>a<sup>4</sup>b<sup>3</sup></i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The appearance of the stanza in English verse is always the sign of
foreign influence. The West Germanic verse, as far back as we have
specimens of it, is uniformly <i>stichic</i> (that is, marked by no periods
save those of the individual verse), not <i>stanzaic</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> On the other
hand, we find the stanza in the Old Norse verse. Sievers's view is that
originally the two sorts of verse existed side by side, the stanzaic
being preferred for chorus delivery, the stichic for individual
recitation; one form at length crowding out the other.</p>

<p>The great organizer of the stanza is, of course, the element of rime.
While unrimed stanzas are familiar in classical verse, the two
innovations, rime and stanza, were introduced together into English
verse, under both Latin and French influences, and have almost
invariably been associated. For notes on the history of the beginnings
of stanza-forms in English, see therefore under Rime, in the following
section.</p>

<p>The <i>terza rima</i> is, strictly speaking, a scheme of continuous verse
rather than a stanza, each tercet being united by the rime-scheme to the
preceding. Its use in English has always been slight, and always due to
conscious imitation of the Italian. No successful attempt has been made
to use it for a long poem, as Dante did in the <i>Divina Commedia</i>.
Wyatt's specimen is the earliest in English; he chose the form for his
three satires imitating those of Alamanni.</p>

rimes, without introducing expletive words that mar the simplicity of

<p>This is the familiar stanza of the early ballads. The omission of rime
in the third line signalizes the fact that the stanza could be (and was)
regarded indifferently as made up either of two long lines or four short
ones. Thus the famous Chevy Chase ballad is found (Ashmole Ms., of about
1560) written in long lines:</p>

<p class="attrib">(See in Fl&uuml;gel's <i>Neuenglisches Lesebuch</i>, vol. i. p. 199.)</p>

<p>The same thing occurs also where there are two rimes to the stanza.
Originally, the extra internal rime was no doubt the cause of the
breaking up of the long couplet into two short lines. (See examples in
Part Two, in the case of the septenary.)</p>

<p>To Davenant's <i>Gondibert</i> is usually traced the use of this "heroic"
stanza (<i>abab</i> in iambic five-stress lines) in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. In his preface the author said: "I believed it
would be more pleasant to the reader, in a work of length, to give this
respite or pause, between every stanza, ... than to run him out of
breath with continued couplets. Nor doth alternate rime by any lowliness
of cadence make the sound less heroic, but rather adapt it to a plain
and stately composing of music." Dryden followed Davenant in using the
stanza for his <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, saying in his preface: "I have chosen
to write my poem in quatrains, or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme,
because I have ever judged them more noble, and of greater dignity, both
for the sound and number, than any other verse in use amongst us.... I
have always found the couplet verse most easy (though not so proper for
this occasion), for there the work is sooner at an end, every two lines
concluding the labor of the poet; but in quatrains he is to carry it
further on, and not only so, but to bear along in his head the
troublesome sense of four lines together." Dryden did not use the stanza
again, however, and it is obviously unsuited to a long narrative poem.
Saintsbury says: "With regard to the nobility and dignity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> this
stanza, it may safely be said that <i>Annus Mirabilis</i> itself, the best
poem ever written therein, killed it by exposing its faults.... It is
chargeable with more than the disjointedness of the couplet, without the
possibility of relief; while, on the other hand, the quatrains have not,
like the Spenserian stave or the <i>ottava rima</i>, sufficient bulk to form
units in themselves." (<i>Life of Dryden</i>, Men of Letters Series, p. 34.)</p>

<p>It is hard to say what Mr. Saintsbury means in speaking of the <i>Annus
Mirabilis</i> as the best poem ever written in the heroic quatrain, when we
remember that it is the quatrain of Gray's <i>Elegy</i>. On the possible
sources of his use of it, see Gosse's <i>Life of Gray</i>, in the Men of
Letters Series, p. 98 (also his <i>From Shakespeare to Pope</i>, p. 140). Mr.
Gosse refers to the use of the quatrain by Sir John Davies in the <i>Nosce
Teipsum</i> (1599), with which Gray was familiar, and (in addition to
Davenant, Dryden, and Hobbes's <i>Homer</i>) to the <i>Love Elegies</i> of James
Hammond, published 1743. "It is believed that the printing of Hammond's
verses incited Gray to begin his <i>Churchyard Elegy</i>, and to make the
four-line stanza the basis of most of his harmonies.... The measure
itself, from first to last, is an attempt to render in English the
solemn alternation of passion and reserve, the interchange of imploring
and desponding tones, that is found in the Latin elegiac; and Gray gave
his poem, when he first published it, an outward resemblance to the text
of Tibullus by printing it without any stanzaic pauses." Mr. Gosse
neglects the elegies of William Shenstone, which were also in the
quatrain, and some of which had apparently been published before the
<i>Churchyard Elegy</i>. On this matter see Beers's <i>Romanticism in the
Eighteenth Century</i>, p. 137, where Shenstone is said to have borrowed
the stanza from Hammond, and Gray from Shenstone. Shenstone, in his
<i>Prefatory Essay on Elegy</i>, defended the metrical form and referred to
the elegies of Hammond. "Heroic metre, with alternate rhyme, seems well
enough adapted to this species of poetry; and, however exceptionable
upon other occasions, its inconveniencies appear to lose their weight in
shorter elegies, and its advantages seem to acquire an additional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
importance. The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a
collection of elegies not long since published." (Chalmers's <i>English
Poets</i>, vol. xiii. p. 264.)</p>

<p>This stanza (<i>abba</i> in four-stress iambics) is commonly known as the
"<i>In Memoriam</i> stanza," from its familiar use by Tennyson. Tennyson is
indeed said to have invented it for his own use, not knowing of its
earlier appearance in the works of Jonson and Rossetti. Professor Corson
has an interesting passage on the poetic quality of the stanza: "By the
rhyme-scheme of the quatrain, the terminal rhyme-emphasis of the stanza
is reduced, the second and third verses being most closely braced by the
rhyme. The stanza is thus admirably adapted to that sweet continuity of
flow, free from abrupt checks, demanded by the spiritualized sorrow
which it bears along. Alternate rhyme would have wrought an entire
change in the tone of the poem. To be assured of this, one should read,
aloud of course, all the stanzas whose first and second, or third and
fourth, verses admit of being transposed without affecting the sense. By
such transposition, the rhymes are made alternate, and the concluding
rhymes more emphatic." Compare the stanza quoted above from section
xxvii. with the transposed form:</p>

<span class="i2">"I feel it when I sorrow most;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">'Tis better to have loved and lost<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Than never to have loved at all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the passage quoted from section lxxxiv. Professor Corson also
observes: "The four stanzas of which it is composed constitute but one
period, the sense being suspended till the close. The rhyme-emphasis is
so distributed that any one, hearing the poem read, would hardly be
sensible of any of the slightest checks in the continuous and even
movement of the verse....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> There is no other section of <i>In Memoriam</i> in
which the artistic motive of the stanza is so evident." (<i>Primer of
English Verse</i>, pp. 70-77.)</p>

<p>In this group of refrain stanzas there is no attempt to make the range
of illustrations complete, but only to suggest how the refrain idea has
been variously used in forming the structure of the stanza. In some
cases, for example, it will be seen that the refrain is a mere appendage
or <i>coda</i> to the stanza; in others it is made by rime a part of the
organized structure.</p>

<p>The special form of refrain stanza appearing in the first of these
foreign specimens (the Alleluia hymn form) is generally thought to have
been the source of the "tail-rime stanza" illustrated in the other two
specimens, and in the several pages which follow. The characteristic
feature of this stanza is the presence of two short lines riming
together and serving as "tails" to the first and second parts of the
body of the stanza. The same name appears in all the languages: "versus
caudati" in the medi&aelig;val Latin, "rime cou&eacute;e" in the French, and
"Schweifreim" in modern German. It is easy to see, what the following
specimens illustrate, how stanzas constructed on this fundamental
principle might be varied greatly in particular forms, according to the
number, length, and rime-arrangement of the longer lines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Manning's chronicle was a translation of the French chronicle of Pierre

form is not represented in the manuscript, though of course implicit in
the rimes. The name of the stanza, "rime cou&eacute;e," appears very early in
Manning's Prologue, in the famous passage in which he expressed his
preference for metrical simplicity:</p>

<p>Lines 15-22 may be paraphrased thus: "If it were made in <i>rime cou&eacute;e</i>,
in <i>rime strangere</i>, or <i>rime entrelac&eacute;e</i>, there are plenty of those who
read English who could not have put the tail-verses together; so that
either in the tail-verse or the <i>baston</i> some would have been confused,
and many men that heard it would not know how it went." The "interlaced"
(alternate) rime was a familiar form. <i>Baston</i> seems usually to be an
equivalent for "stanza" or "stave." It seems uncertain whether by <i>rime
strangere</i> Manning had in mind any particular form of stanza or
rime-arrangement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>In these stanzas a pair of long lines bind together the first and second
parts of the composition, just as the short lines do in the original
<i>rime cou&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>Young was and is universally condemned for choosing this form of stanza
for his odes. He was led to do so by his admiration for the passage in
Dryden's <i>Ode for St. Cecilia's Day</i>, running:</p>

<span class="i5">"Assumes the god,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Affects to nod,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And seems to shake the spheres."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, said Young, Dryden was expressing "majesty"; hence, since he
wished his odes to be majestic, he used the short, choppy measure
throughout. (See his Introductory Essay to his Odes, in Chalmers's
<i>English Poets</i>, vol. xiii.) On the other hand, the stanza as used by
Read has been almost universally admired.</p>

<p>The "rime royal" stanza is one of Chaucer's contributions to English
verse, and about 14,000 lines of his poetry are in this form. Its use by
King James in the <i>King's Quhair</i> was formerly thought to be the source
of the name; but it seems more likely that the name, like the form, was
of French origin, and is to be connected with such terms as <i>chant
royal</i> and <i>ballat royal</i>, familiar in the nomenclature of courtly
poetry (see Schipper, vol. i. p. 426). The stanza was used by Chaucer
with marvellous skill for purposes of continuous narrative, and was a
general favorite among his imitators in the fifteenth century, being
used by Lydgate, Occleve, Hawes, Dunbar, then by Skelton, and by Barclay
in the <i>Ship of Fooles</i>. It appears popular as late as the time of
Sackville's part of the <i>Mirror for Magistrates</i> (1563).<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Later than
Shakspere's <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> it is rarely found. (But see Milton's
unfinished poem on <i>The Passion</i>, where he used a form of the rime royal
with concluding alexandrine.)</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the "rime royal" is always in five-stress verse, but
in the following specimen the same rime-scheme appears in the irregular
six-or-seven-stress verse of one of the Mysteries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the <i>ottava rima</i>, as used by Frere and Byron, Austin Dobson says:
"It had already been used by Harrington, Drayton, Fairfax, and (as we
have seen) in later times by Gay; it had even been used by Frere's
contemporary, William Tennant; but to Frere belongs the honor of giving
it the special characteristics which Byron afterward popularised in
<i>Beppo</i> and <i>Don Juan</i>. Structurally the <i>ottava rima</i> of Frere
singularly resembles that of Byron, who admitted that <i>Whistlecraft</i> was
his 'immediate model.' ... Byron, taking up the stanza with equal skill
and greater genius, filled it with the vigor of his personality, and
made it a measure of his own, which it has ever since been hazardous for
inferior poets to attempt." (Ward's <i>English Poets</i>, vol. iv. p. 240.)
Byron may indeed be said&mdash;in the words of the present specimen&mdash;to have
turned what was commonly a romantic stanza "to burlesque."</p>

<p>This stanza, which Spenser invented for his own use and to which his
name is always given, was apparently formed by add<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ing an alexandrine to
the <i>ababbcbc</i> stanza of Chaucer. In it Spenser wrote the greater part
of his poetry, and its use marks the Spenserian influence wherever
found, especially among the poets of the eighteenth century,&mdash;Thomson,
Shenstone, Beattie, and the like.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell, in his Essay on Spenser, comments as follows: "He
found the <i>ottava rima</i> ... not roomy enough, so first ran it over into
another line, and then ran that added line over into an alexandrine, in
which the melody of one stanza seems forever longing and feeling forward
after that which is to follow.... Wave follows wave with equable
gainings and recessions, the one sliding back in fluent music to be
mingled with and carried forward by the next. In all this there is
soothingness, indeed, but no slumberous monotony; for Spenser was no
mere metrist, but a great composer. By the variety of his pauses&mdash;now at

<p>Thomson's <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, although not published till 1748, seems
to have been written and circulated before Shenstone's <i>Schoolmistress</i>.
Thomson caught the spirit of Spenser and his stanza better than any
other imitator until the days of Keats. On the revival of the stanza at
this period, see Beers's <i>English Romanticism in the Eighteenth
Century</i>, chap. iii., on "the Spenserians." Earliest of the group,
according to Mr. Gosse, was Akenside's <i>Virtuoso</i> (1737. See <i>Eighteenth

<p>With reference to his use of this stanza Shelley remarked, in the
Preface to <i>The Revolt of Islam</i>: "I have adopted the stanza of Spenser
(a measure inexpressibly beautiful), not because I consider it a finer
model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of Shakespeare and
Milton, but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity:
you must either succeed or fail.... But I was enticed also by the
brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been
nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious
arrangement of the pauses of this measure." Professor Corson (<i>Primer of
English Verse</i>, p. 112) quotes Mr. Todhunter as saying: "Compare the
impetuous rapidity and pale intensity of Shelley's verse with the
lulling harmony, the lingering cadence, the voluptuous color of
Spenser's, or with the grandiose majesty of Byron's.... In <i>Adonais</i>,
indeed, a poem on which he bestowed much labor, he handles the stanza in
a masterly manner, and endows it with an individual music beautiful and
new."</p>

<p>Mr. Israel Gollancz says, in his Introduction to this poem: "I can point
to no direct source to which the poet of <i>Pearl</i> was indebted for his
measure; that it ultimately belongs to Romance poetry I have little
doubt. These twelve-line verses seem to me to resemble the earliest form
of the sonnet more than anything else I have as yet discovered.... Be
this as it may, all will, I hope, recognize that there is a distinct
gain in giving to the 101 stanzas of the poem the appearance of a sonnet
sequence, marking clearly the break between the initial octave and the
closing quatrain.... The refrain, the repetition of the catch-word of
each verse, the trammels of alliteration, all seem to have offered no
difficulty to our poet; and if power over technical difficulties
constitutes in any way a poet's greatness, the author of <i>Pearl</i>, from
this point of view alone, must take high rank among English poets."
(Introduction, pp. xxiv, xxv.)</p>

<p>This and the two following specimens, together with some included
earlier under the head of Tail-Rime, illustrate the interest in complex
lyrical measures characteristic of the period of French influence in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In 1152 Henry of Normandy (who
ascended the throne in 1154) married Eleanor of Poitou, and in her train
there came to England the great troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn. On the
poems of this troubadour and others of the same school, see ten Brink's
<i>English Literature</i>, Kennedy translation, vol. i. pp. 159-164. Other
troubadours followed, and found a home in the court of Richard the
Lion-Hearted, who himself entered the ranks of the poets. The result was
a great mass of Norman French lyrical poetry, often in intricate forms,
and a smaller mass of imitative lyrics in Middle English. As Schipper
observes, the elaborate lyrical forms were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> inconsistent with English
taste, and it was only the simpler ones which were widely adopted. On
the general character of the Romance stanza-forms, and their influence
in England, see Schipper, vol. i. pp. 309 ff.</p>

<p>This verse of the early Mystery Plays and connected forms of the drama
shows an extraordinary variety of measures. In general, the effort of
the writers seems to have been to show some artistic ingenuity of
structure, and at the same time keep to the free popular dialogue verse
which was associated with the plays. We find, therefore, tumbling verse,
alexandrines, septenaries, and intricate strophic forms, all commonly

<h2><a name="IV_TONE-QUALITY" id="IV_TONE-QUALITY"></a>IV. TONE-QUALITY</h2>


<p>The quality of the sounds of the words used in verse, although in no way
concerned in the rhythm, is an element of some importance. The
sound-quality may be used in either of two ways: as a regular
co&ouml;rdinating element in the structure of the verse, or as a sporadic
element in the beauty or melody of the verse.</p>


<h4>A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT</h4>

<p>In this capacity, similar qualities of sound indicate co&ouml;rdinated parts
of the verse-structure, thus emphasizing the idea of similarity
(corresponding to that of symmetry in arts expressed in space) which is
at the very basis of rhythmical composition.</p>

<p>Obviously, the similarity may exist between vowel sounds, consonant
sounds, or both; more specifically, it is found either in initial
consonants, in accented vowels, or in accented vowels plus final
consonants. Properly speaking, the term Rime is applicable to all three
cases; the first being distinguished as initial rime or Alliteration
(German <i>Anreim</i> or <i>Stabreim</i>); the second as Assonance (<i>Stimmreim</i>),
the third as complete Rime (<i>Vollreim</i>). English usage commonly reserves
the term Rime for the third class.</p>


<h5>i. <i>Assonance</i></h5>

<p>Assonance was the characteristic co&ouml;rdinating element in the verse of
the early Romance languages, the Proven&ccedil;al, Old French, and Spanish.
Thus in the <i>Chanson de Roland</i> (eleventh century) we find the verses of
each <i>laisse</i>, or strophe, bound together by assonance. Frequently this
develops into full rime by chance or convenience. The following is a
characteristic group of verses from the <i>Roland</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

Elsewhere verse bound together only by assonance is almost unknown in

William Larminie has an interesting article giving a favorable account

larger use in English poetry, as a relief from the&mdash;to him&mdash;almost

characteristic of the primitive Germanic tongues.</p>

<p>This specimen represents the use of alliteration in the most regularly
constructed Anglo-Saxon verse. The two half-lines are united into the
long line by the same initial consonant in the important syllables. In
the first half-line the alliteration is on the two principally stressed
syllables, or on one of them alone (most frequently the first); in the
second half-line it is commonly found only on the first. Alliterating
unstressed syllables are usually regarded as merely accidental. Any
initial vowel sound alliterates with any other vowel sound.</p>

<p>The most regular verse appears in Anglo-Saxon poetry of what may be
called the classical period,&mdash;700 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> and for a century
following,&mdash;represented by <i>Beowulf</i> and the poems of Cynewulf. By the
time of &AElig;lfric, who wrote about 1000 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> there appear signs of a
breaking in the regular verse-form. (See Schipper, vol. i. pp. 60 ff.)
For example, two alliterative syllables often appear in the second
half-line; one half-line may be without alliteration; alliteration may
bind different long-lines together; or alliteration may be altogether
wanting. There are also additions of many light syllables, resulting
almost, as Schipper observes, in rhythmical prose. These tendencies
resulted in the wholly irregular use of alliteration appearing in much
of the verse of the early Middle English period, illustrated in the
specimens that follow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The origins of alliteration in Germanic verse are lost in the general
mass of Germanic origins. It is almost universally regarded as a purely
native development, although M. Kawczynski (<i>Essai Comparatif sur
l'Origine et l'Histoire des Rythmes</i>; Paris, 1889) sets forth the
remarkable opinion that the Germans derived their alliteration from the
Romans. "We must remember," he says, "the schools of rhetoric existing
in Gaul in the sixth and seventh centuries, where alliteration seems to
have been held in esteem.... It became more and more frequent in the
Latin poetry of the Carlovingian period, and it will suffice to cite
here the following verses from Milo of Saint Amand:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Pastores pecum primi pressique pavore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Conspicuos cives carmen caeleste canentes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Audivere astris arrectis auribus; auctor<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ad terras ...'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It early passed to Ireland, and the Irish made use of it in their Latin
poetry and in their national poetry. The example of the Irish was
followed by the Anglo-Saxons, although these last had derived the same
rules from the Latin writers.... The Anglo-Saxons, who sent the second
series of apostles to the Germans, taught them the use of alliteration
in poetry. The Scandinavians, on their side, learned it also from the
Anglo-Saxons." This theory has found no adherents among scholars, and M.
Kawczynski's illustrations are probably most useful in emphasizing the
natural pleasure in similarity of sound found among all peoples. See
below, on the related question of the origin of end-rime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h5>iii. <i>Rime</i> (<i>i.e. end-rime</i>)</h5>

<p>Full rime, or end-rime, involves the principally stressed vowel in the
riming word, and all that follows that vowel. When there is an entire
unstressed syllable following, the rime is called double, or feminine.
Triple rime is also recognized, though rare.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> End-rime being a
stranger to the early Germanic languages, its appearance in any of them
may commonly be taken as a sign of foreign influence. In general, of
course, rime and the stanza were introduced together into English verse,
under the influence of Latin hymns and French lyrics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>The functions of rime in English verse may perhaps be grouped under
three heads: the function of emphasis, the function of forming beautiful
or pleasurable sounds, and the function of combining or organizing the
verses. It is with reference to the first of these that Professor Corson
speaks of rime as "an enforcing agency of the individual verse." Under
the second head rime is considered simply as a form of tone-color, and
as furnishing a part of the melody of verse. The third function, by
which individual verses are bound into stanzas, is, in a sense, the most
important.</p>

<p>On the subject of the &aelig;sthetic values of rime, see the chapter on
"poetic unities" in Corson's <i>Primer of English Verse</i>, and Ehrenfeld's
<i>Studien zur Theorie des Reims</i> (Z&uuml;rich, 1897). The problem of the
relative values of rimed and unrimed verse will come up in connection
with the history of the heroic couplet and of blank verse. The objection
always urged against rime is that its demands are likely to turn the
poet aside from the normal order of his ideas. Herder, as Ehrenfeld
points out, thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> that this was particularly true of English verse,
the uninflected language not providing so naturally for cases where
thought and sound are parallel. A recent protest against the tyranny of
rime is found in the article by Mr. Larminie, cited on page 115, where
it is claimed that undue attention to form is thinning out the substance
of modern poetry, and that the demands of rime should be relaxed. See
also Ben Jonson's "Fit of Rhyme against Rhyme," for a humorous complaint
against the requirements of rime upon the poet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The origin of rime has been a subject of prolonged controversy. See the
monograph by Ehrenfeld already cited; Meyer's <i>Anfang und Ursprung der
rythmischen Dichtung</i> (Munich, 1884); W. Grimm's <i>Geschichte des Reims</i>
(1851); Norden's <i>Antike Kunstprosa</i> (Leipzig, 1898; <i>Anhang ueber die
Geschichte des Reims</i>); Kluge's article, <i>Zur Geschichte des Reimes im
Altgermanischen</i>, in Paul u. Braune's <i>Beitr&auml;ge</i>, vol. ix. p. 422; and
Schipper, vol. i. pp. 34 ff. Meyer's work is an exposition of the theory
that rime was an importation from the Orient. In like manner, it has
been held by many that the poetry of Otfried (the first regularly rimed
German verse) was produced under Latin influence wholly, and that rime
was introduced by him to the Germans (see the work by Kawczynski, cited
p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_117">117</a>). Herder (see Ehrenfeld's monograph) regarded rime as a natural
growth of the instinct for symmetry in all human taste, closely
connected with dance-rhythms, all forms of parallelism, and the like.
Similarity of inflectional endings in similar clauses, he pointed out,
would naturally develop rime in any inflected language. This view is in
line with the tendency of recent opinion. Schipper says, in effect: "Is
rime to be regarded as the invention of a special people, like the
Arabian, or is it a form of art which developed in the poetic language
of the Aryan peoples, separately in the several nations? In the opinion
of the principal scholars the latter opinion is the correct one. The
chief support of this opinion is the fact that traces of rime, in
greater or less number, appear in the oldest poetry of almost all the
partially civilized peoples. 'It is,' says C. F. Meyer, 'something
inborn, original, universally human, like poetry and music, and no more
than these the special invention of a single people or a particular
time.' In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> fact, traces of rime may be noticed in the poetry of the
Greeks, in Homer, &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, as also in the
poetry of the Romans; in a more developed form it appears in the late
middle Latin clerical poetry. In the Celtic languages, moreover, rime is
the indispensable mark of the poetic form, even in the oldest extant
specimens. The Latin poetry just referred to gives interesting evidence
that rime is a characteristic sign of popular poetry. While the
quantitative system became dominant, with the artistic verse-forms of
the Greeks, in the Golden Age of Roman literature, the early Saturnian
verses, written in free rhythms, already showed the popular taste for
similarity of sound in the form of alliteration; and in the
post-classical time, with the fall of the quantitative metres, rime
again came to the front in songs intended for the people. The same
element was made so essential a characteristic in the organization of
verse in the medi&aelig;val Latin, that 'carmen rhythmicum' came to signify a
rimed poem, and the later Latinists used the word 'rhythmus' precisely
in the sense of 'rime.'"</p>

<p>Schipper goes on to inquire whether this medi&aelig;val Latin poetry was the
means of introducing rime to the Germanic peoples. Wackernagel held it
as certain that Otfried learned his rimes from Latin poems; but as
Otfried declares that his poetry is intended to take the place of
useless popular songs, it seems probable that he was not using an
innovation, and that rime was already popular in Old High German.
Indeed, it appears sporadically in the <i>Hildebrandslied</i> and the
<i>Heliand</i>. Grimm observes that it is theoretically unlikely that
alliteration should have vanished suddenly and rime as suddenly have
taken its place. The gradual development of rime from assonance among
the Romance peoples suggests the same thing. The early appearance of
rime by the side of alliteration is illustrated by C. F. Meyer
(<i>Historische Studien</i>, Leipzig, 1851) from the Norse <i>Edda</i>, from
<i>Beowulf</i>, C&aelig;dmon, etc. In the later Anglo-Saxon period rime was
evidently securing a considerable though uncertain hold. The Riming Poem
suggests what development rime might have had in English without the
incoming of Romance influences. Grimm observes that, while to his mind
alliteration was a finer and nobler quality than rime, there was need of
a stronger sound-likeness which should hold the attention more firmly by
its unchanging place at the end of the line. Schipper remarks, finally,
that the fact that the use of rime in connection with alliteration was
especially popular in the southern half of England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> where the Romance
influence was strongest, may suggest why in the more purely Germanic
northern half alliteration remained the single support of the poetic
form well into the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The appendix to the work of Norden, cited above, is a fuller development
of ideas frequently suggested by the sporadic appearance of rime in
early Greek and Latin literature. Norden gives many examples of this
"rhetorical rime," as well as of rime arising naturally from parallelism
of sentence structure found in primitive charms, incantations, and the
like. In particular he emphasizes the influence of the figure of
<i>hom&oelig;oteleuton</i> as used in the literary prose of the classical
languages. His conclusion is as follows: "Rime, then, was potentially as
truly present in the Greek and Latin languages, from the earliest times,
as in every other language; but in the metrical (quantitative) poetry it
had no regular place, and appeared there in general only sporadically
and by chance, being used by only a few poets as a rhetorical ornament.
It became actual by the transition from the metrical poetry to the
rhythmical (that is, the syllable-counting, in which&mdash;in the Latin&mdash;the
chief consideration is still for the word-accent); and this transition
was consummated by the aid of the highly poetic prose, already used for
centuries, which was constructed according to the laws of rhythm, and in
which the rhetorical hom&oelig;oteleuton had gained an ever-increasing
significance. In particular, rime found an entrance through sermons
composed in such prose, and delivered in a voice closely approaching
that of singing, into the hymn-poetry which was intimately related to
such sermons. From the Latin hymn-poetry it was carried into other
languages, from the ninth century onward. It is self-evident that in
these languages also rime was potentially present before it became
actual through the influence of foreign poetry; for in this region also
there operates the highest immanent law of every being and every form of
development,&mdash;that in the whole field of life nothing absolutely new is
invented, but merely slumbering germs are awakened to active life."

The Romance words in the hymn indicate the presence of French influence.

<p>These passages illustrate sufficiently the grotesque effects of double
and triple rime in English verse,&mdash;effects of which Byron and Browning
are the unquestioned masters. Professor Corson observes that the double
rime is to be regarded as the means of "some special emphasis," whether
serious or humorous. More commonly the effect is humorous, of course, as
in <i>Don Juan</i>, where the rimes indicate "the lowering of the poetic
key&mdash;the reduction of true poetic seriousness." The rimes in the <i>Flight
of the Duchess</i> Mr. Edmund Gurney has said sometimes "pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>duce the
effect of jokes made during the performance of a symphony." The specimen
which follows illustrates the use of these double and triple rimes for a
wholly serious purpose. Professor Corson remarks that in this case the
rime serves "as a most effective foil to the melancholy theme. It is not
unlike the laughter of frenzied grief." It is interesting to note that
in the Italian language, where double rimes are almost constant,
masculine rimes are sometimes used for grotesque effect in the same way
that English poets use the feminine.</p>

<h6><i>Internal rime.</i></h6>

<p>Internal rime may be regarded on the one side as only a matter of the
division of the verse, since if it occurs regularly at the medial
cesura, it practically breaks the verse into two parts. On the other
side, if used only sporadically, it is a matter of tone-color. It
sometimes appears, however, in forms which entitle it to recognition by
itself. The earliest of these forms is the "Leonine rime," which is said
to have taken its name from Leoninus of St. Victor, who in the twelfth
century wrote elegiacs (hexameters and pentameters) in which the
syllable preceding the cesura regularly rimed with the final syllable.
Obviously lines of this kind would easily break up into riming
half-lines. Similarly, in septenary verse internal rime was often used
together with end-rime, with a resulting resolution into short-line
stanzas riming either <i>aabb</i> or <i>abab</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The following specimen from

<h4>B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR)</h4>

<p>This division includes the use made of the qualities of sound for the
purpose of adding to the melodiousness of verse, or of expressing in
some measure the ideas to be conveyed by means of the very sounds
employed. Sometimes this takes the form of alliteration, differing from
that of early English verse only in that it follows no regular
structural laws. On the other hand, it may take the form of
<i>onomatop&oelig;ia</i>, the figure of speech in which sound and sense are
closely related,&mdash;as in descriptive words like <i>buzz</i>, <i>hiss</i>, <i>murmur</i>,
<i>splash</i>, and the like. The term Tone-color is formed by analogy with
the German <i>Klangfarbe</i>, an expression apparently due to the feeling
that the sound-qualities of speech have somewhat the same function as
the various colors in a picture. It is unquestionably true that the
selection of sounds, whether vowel or consonantal, has much to do with
the melodious effect of very much poetry. The poet may choose the
different sound-qualities (so far as the sense permits) just as the
musician may choose the varying qualities of the different instruments
in the orchestra or the different stops in the organ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, this matter of Tone-color is not a part of verse-form
in the same sense as matters of rhythm, rime, and the like; for it may
appear in prose as well as in verse, and is not in any case reducible to
formal principles or laws. Yet its use in actual verse is so important,
and it is so closely related to the use of sound-quality in the form of
rime and alliteration, that it seems well to include it here.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. Guest treats sounds as having in themselves the suggestion of more
or less definite ideas, this suggestiveness being explainable by
physical causes. Thus the trembling character of <i>l</i> suggests
trepidation, as in "Double, double, toil and trouble." <i>R</i> suggests
harsh, grating, or rattling noises; the sibilants are appropriate to the
expression of shrieks, screams, and the like; <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>, because of
the compression of the lips, suggest muscular effort; <i>st</i>, from a
sudden stopping of the <i>s</i>, suggests fear or surprise; <i>f</i> and <i>h</i> also
fear, because of their whispering quality. Hollow sounds (<i>au</i>, <i>ow</i>,
<i>o</i>, and the like) suggest depth and fulness. Guest quotes in this
connection an interesting passage from Bacon's <i>Natural History</i> (ii.
200): "There is found a similitude between the sound that is made by
inanimate bodies, or by animate bodies that have no voice articulate,
and divers letters of articulate voices; and commonly men have given
such names to those sounds as do allude unto the articulate letters; as
trembling of hot water hath resemblance unto the letter <i>l</i>; quenching
of hot metals with the letter <i>z</i>; snarling of dogs with the letter <i>r</i>;
the noise of screech-owls with the letter <i>sh</i>; voice of cats with the
diphthong <i>eu</i>; voice of cuckoos with the diphthong <i>ou</i>; sounds of
strings with the diphthong <i>ng</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p></div>

<p>A. W. Schlegel went even farther in suggesting a subtle symbolism in
sounds apart from descriptive qualities. Thus he regarded <i>a</i> as
suggestive of bright red, and as symbolizing youth, joy, or brightness
(as in the words <i>Strahl</i>, <i>Klang</i>, <i>Glans</i>); <i>i</i> as suggestive of
sky-blue, symbolic of intimacy or love; and so with other vowel sounds.
(See Ehrenfeld's monograph, p. 57.) In general it may be said that it is
dangerous to attempt to explain the special effects of tone-color in
verse, except where it is obviously descriptive, the appreciation of
such effects being a subtle and a more or less individual matter. On
this subject Mr. Gurney makes some interesting observations, in the
essays cited above. He believes that the pleasurable effect of the
sound-qualities in verse can never be dissociated from the sense of the
words; that the most melodious verse cannot be appreciated if in a
foreign language, unless read with particular expressiveness; and that
the pleasure derived from what we roughly call melodious or harmonious
verses is always due to the mystical combination of the appropriate
sound with the poetic content.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson ridiculed the idea of tone-color, as appearing in Pope's
teaching that the sound should be "an echo to the sense." See his <i>Life
of Pope</i>, and especially the <i>Idler</i> for June 9, 1759, in which he
describes Minim the critic as reading "all our poets with particular
attention to this delicacy of versification." Such a critic discovers
wonders in these lines from <i>Hudibras</i>:</p>

<span class="i2">"Honor is like the glossy bubble,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which cost philosophers such trouble;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where, one part crack'd, the whole does fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wits are crack'd to find out why."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"In these verses, says Minim, we have two striking accommodations of the
sound to the sense. It is impossible to utter the first two lines
emphatically without an act like that which they describe; <i>bubble</i> and
<i>trouble</i> causing a momentary inflation of the cheeks by the retention
of the breath, which is afterwards forcibly emitted, as in the practice
of <i>blowing bubbles</i>. But the greatest excellence is in the third line,
which is <i>crack'd</i> in the middle to express a crack, and then shivers
into monosyllables."</p>

<p>In an article on "Some Technical Elements of Style in Literature"
(originally published in the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, April, 1885;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
reprinted in the Scribner edition of Stevenson's Works, vol. xxii. p.
243) Robert Louis Stevenson discussed some of the more subtle effects of
vowel and consonant color, as appearing in both prose and verse. The
combination and repetition of the consonants PVF he found to be
particularly frequent. The pervading sound-elements in the two following

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> "Perfect rime" is a term applied to rimes between two
words identical in form, but different in meaning. It is inadmissible in
modern English verse, although it was considered entirely proper in
Middle English times (compare Chaucer's&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">That hem hath holpen, whan that they were <i>seke</i>."),<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
and is still common in French verse.
</p><p>
Schipper gives a separate paragraph also to "unaccented rime," where the
similarity of sound belongs wholly to final, unstressed syllables.
Generally speaking, this is inadmissible in English verse. Schipper
quotes from Thomas Moore:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Down in yon summervale<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where the rill flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus said the Nightingale<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To his loved Rose."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
It might be said, however, that the final syllables of "summervale" and
"nightingale" are not wholly unstressed; moreover, they are in the first
and third verses of the stanza, where rime is not indispensable.
Unaccented rime is most noticeable in some of the verse of the
transition period in the sixteenth century, when the syllable-counting
principle was so emphasized as to admit any license of accent so long as
the proper number of syllables was observed. Thus, in the verse of Wyatt
we find such rimes as "dreadeth" and "seeketh," "beginning" and
"eclipsing," etc. See p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_10">10</a>, above.
</p><p>
Imperfect rime, occurring where the vowel sounds are only similar, not
identical, or where the consonants following them are not identical, is
commonly regarded as an imperfection in verse form. The most common of
these imperfect rimes are in cases where the spelling would indicate
perfect rime (hence where, in many cases, the words rimed originally,
but have separated in the changes of pronunciation), such as <i>love</i> and
<i>move</i>, <i>broad</i> and <i>load</i>, and the like. For a defence of these "rimes
to the eye," and other imperfect rimes, with a study of their use by
English poets, see articles by Prof. A. G. Newcomer in the <i>Nation</i> for
January 26 and February 2, 1899.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Rime also appears in a short passage in Cynewulf's
<i>Elene</i>. Some have thought it a later interpolation, but Schipper thinks
it indicates that Cynewulf was a Northumbrian. Grein believes him to
have been the author also of the Riming Poem, but, as Rieger points out,
the rimes of Cynewulf are of a much less systematic character. (On this

<h3>I. FOUR-STRESS VERSE</h3>


<p>English verse of four stresses is chiefly to be divided into two groups:
that representing the primitive Germanic tendency to emphasize the
element of accent rather than the counting of syllables, and that
produced under foreign influence, showing comparative regularity in the
number of syllables to the verse. The first group is made up of the
various descendants of the original "long line," sometimes rimed and
sometimes unrimed; the second group of forms of the familiar
octosyllabic couplet. (Of modern verse only iambic measures are included
here.)</p>


<h4>A.&mdash;NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING</h4>

<p>The earliest English verse, like early Germanic verse generally, is
based on the recurrence of strong accents, and is composed of a long
line made up of two short lines, or half-lines, which are bound together
by alliteration. As to the number of accents to be counted in the line,
there are two theories, the "two-accent" and the "four-accent."
According to the first, we should count two accents to the half-line,
and four to the long line; according to the second, we should count four
to the half-line and eight to the long line. The distinction is not so
marked, however, as would appear at first thought; for the two-accent
theorists recognize a considerable number of secondary accents in
addition to the principal ones, while the four-accent theorists
recognize half the accents as being commonly weaker than the other half.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The four-accent theory is that of Lachmann, represented chiefly in more
recent scholarship by ten Brink and Kaluza. Lachmann <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>took, as the
typical Germanic line, such a verse as this from the <i>Hildebrandlied</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Garutun se iro gu&eth;hama:    gurtun sih iro suert ana;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but admitted that the Anglo-Saxon line was a departure from the type in
the direction of fewer accents. Ten Brink, however, found the full
number of accents in the typical Anglo-Saxon line. "It is based upon a
measure which belonged to the antiquity of all Germanic races, namely,
the line with eight emphatic syllables, divided into equal parts by the
cesura." (<i>English Literature</i>, trans. Kennedy, vol. i. pp. 21, 22.) The
principal representative of the two-accent theory is Sievers, whose
conclusions have been pretty generally accepted by English and American
scholars. He admits that very many, perhaps most, Anglo-Saxon lines can
be read with eight accents, but shows that there is still a large
proportion (some eleven hundred in <i>Beowulf</i>) which cannot be so read
without wrenching the natural reading. On this subject, see Westphal's
<i>Allgemeine Metrik</i>, Sievers's <i>Altgermanische Metrik</i>, Kaluza's <i>Der
Altenglische Vers</i>, and the articles by Sievers, Luick, and ten Brink in
Paul's <i>Grundriss der Germanische Philologie</i>.</p></div>

<p>Aside from the two-part structure of the long line, the number of
accents, and the alliteration, Anglo-Saxon verse is marked by the usual
coincidence of the principal accents with long syllables. The unaccented
parts of the line vary in both the number and length of the syllables.
In general, each half-line is divided into two feet, or measures; and,
according to the structure of these feet, the ordinary half-lines of
Anglo-Saxon verse have been reduced by Sievers to five fundamental
types.</p>

<p>Type A is represented by such a half-line as "sti&eth;um wordum."</p>

<p>Type B inverts the rhythm of A, as in the half-line "n&#275;
wintersc&#363;r."</p>


<p>Type C is characterized by the juxtaposition of the two accents, as in
the half-line "and for&eth; gangan."</p>

<p>Type D commonly has only the accented syllable in the first foot, while
the second foot is characterized by a sort of dactylic rhythm, as in the
half-lines "s&#483;l&#299;&eth;ende" and "flet innanweard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Type E inverts the rhythm of D, as in the half-line "gylp-wordum
spr&aelig;c."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In all the types many variations are found. The beginning of the line
may show anacrusis, and two short syllables may take the place of a long
syllable; while an indeterminate number of light syllables may often be
introduced before or after the principal accents.</p>

<p>These closing lines of the poem furnish an important opportunity to
compare the Latin half-lines with those in Anglo-Saxon. Each half seems
to be influenced by the metrical nature of the other; the Anglo-Saxon
being a little more regular in the number of syllables than usual, the
Latin less regular. Since, to the ear of the writer, the two halves of
each verse were doubtless fairly equivalent, metrically, and since each
of the Latin half-lines appears to have two accents, these combination
verses have been thought to be an argument for the "two-accent" theory
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> Anglo-Saxon verse. On the other hand, the advocates of the
four-accent theory would read the Latin half-lines with four stresses
each, on the ground that nearly every syllable was stressed in the
chanting of such religious verse (<i>l&uacute;-c&iacute;s a&uacute;c-t&oacute;r</i>, etc.).</p>

<p class="attrib">(<i>King Horn</i>, ll. 1-12. ab. 1200-1250.)</p>

<p>The metre of <i>King Horn</i> is very irregular, and has proved somewhat
puzzling to scholars. It seems to be the direct result of the primitive
"long line" broken into two halves by internal rime. The number of
accents varies greatly: we may have verses which are easily read with
two, such as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Into schupes borde<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At the furst worde."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet these it is evident might also be read with three accents, as in the
following couplet also:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The se bigan to flowe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Horn child to rowe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>According as one reads the Anglo-Saxon verse with two or four accents to
the half-line, he will regard the typical half-line of <i>King Horn</i> as
made up of two or four accents. If the fundamental number was two, the
additional accented syllables were doubtless introduced under the
influence of the French eight-syllable couplet. It is not difficult to
see how the more regular (Latin or French) and the less regular (native)
measures might have been confused, and soon have coalesced in popular
use. Ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> Brink, reading the <i>King Horn</i> lines with four accents, speaks
of them as "formed entirely on the Teutonic principle, with two accents
upon the sonorous close of the verse, so that it appears to be an
organic continuation of the chief form in Layamon and in &AElig;lfred's
<i>Proverbs</i>. This circumstance makes the poem exceptional among the early
English romances." He also speaks of "an unmistakably strophic
construction in the text as we have it." (<i>English Literature</i>, Kennedy
translation, vol. i. p. 227.)</p>

<p>These two specimens, both doubtless the work of the same author (to whom
are also attributed the <i>Pearl</i> and <i>Cleanness</i>), represent the
patriotic revival of the alliterative long line by contemporaries of
Chaucer in the latter half of the fourteenth century. In <i>Sir Gawayne</i>
the rimeless long line is gathered into strophes, each of which
concludes with four riming lines. (See above, p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_109">109</a>.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For analysis of this revived alliterative verse, see a valuable article
by Dr. Luick, <i>Die Englische Stabreimzeile im 14n, 15n, und 16n
Jahrhundert</i>, in <i>Anglia</i>, vol. xi. pp. 392 and 553. Luick analyzes not
only the poems of the "Pearl poet," but also the <i>Troy Book</i>, the
<i>Alexander Fragments</i>, <i>William of Palerne</i>, <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i>,
<i>Morte Arthure</i>, and minor poems. He finds the <i>Troy Book</i> the most
regular alliterative poem of Middle English, but in all of the group a
general tendency to preserve not only the early laws of alliteration but
also the "five types" of Sievers's Anglo-Saxon metrics. Dr. Luick
attributes the final decline of the old measure in large degree to the
falling away of the final syllables in <i>-e</i>, etc.; without these
numerous feminine endings the primitive "long line" was impossible. This
he regards as regrettable, since the old alliterative verse, "growing up
on native soil with the language itself," represented the natural
accent-relations of the Germanic languages, especially the recognition
of two principal degrees of accent; whereas the modern rimed verse
requires the reduction of this to a uniform "tick-tack" of alternating
stress and non-stress.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Spenser's use of the tumbling verse in the <i>Shepherd's Calendar</i> was a
part of his imitation of older forms for the sake of an uncultivated,
bucolic effect. In his hands the irregular measure showed a tendency to
reduce itself to regular ten-syllable lines, like the first two of the
present specimen, which, by themselves, might easily be read as
decasyllabic iambics. On this, see further under Five-Stress Verse.
Spenser was perhaps the last cultivated poet to use the irregular
measure, until we come to modern imitators of the early popular poetry.
The following specimen is of this class.</p>

<h4>B.&mdash;SYLLABLE-COUNTING (OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET)</h4>

<p>The more regular four-stress verse, in rimed couplets showing a tendency
to be octosyllabic, we have seen to be generally attributed to the
influence of the French octosyllabics, which were in common use in late
medi&aelig;val French poetry, such as that of Wace and Chrestien de Troyes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>According to Stengel (in Gr&ouml;ber's <i>Grundriss der Romanischen
Philologie</i>), this octosyllabic French verse goes back to a lost vulgar
Latin verse; this view is opposed by Dr. C. M. Lewis, in his <i>Foreign
Sources of Modern English Versification</i> (Yale Studies in English,
1898), who finds its origin in the tetrameter of the Latin hymns. Dr.
Lewis also attributes to this Latin verse more direct influence on
English verse than is commonly assumed. Thus he finds in it, rather than
in the French octosyllabics, the model of the verse of the <i>Pater
Noster</i>, quoted below. The argument is briefly this: the Latin verse was
both accentual and syllabic; the French verse was syllabic but not
accentual; that of the <i>Pater Noster</i> is accentual but not syllabic;
hence it is more nearly like the Latin than the French. A stanza of the
Latin tetrameter, cited by Dr. Lewis from the hymn <i>Aurora lucis
rutilat</i>, is as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Tristes erat apostoli<br /></span>
<span class="i2">de nece sui Domini,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">quem p&oelig;na mortis crudeli<br /></span>
<span class="i2">servi damnarunt impii."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Compare these lines from the <i>Brut</i> of Wace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Adunt apela Cordeille<br /></span>
<span class="i2">qui esteit sa plus joes ne fille;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">que Raga&uuml; ne la premiere<br /></span>
<span class="i2">quida que el e cune&uuml;st<br /></span>
<span class="i2">que plus chier des al tres l'e&uuml;st.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">et bien out en sun cuer not&eacute;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">cument ses deus sorurs parlo&euml;nt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">cument lur pere losengo&euml;nt."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p><p>The last four verses of this passage are cited by Schipper as
illustrating the regular iambic character of the French octosyllabics;
but Dr. Lewis regards the measure as purely syllabic, with no regard for
alternation of accents, and instances the earlier lines of the passage
as being quite as nearly anapestic as iambic. (See Schipper, vol. i. p.
107, and Lewis's monograph, as cited above, pp. 73 ff. See also Crow:
<i>Zur Geschichte des Kurzen Reimpaares in Mittel Englisch.</i>) Dr. Lewis's
conclusion is: "We may therefore sum up the whole history of our
octosyllabic verse in this way: we borrowed its number of accents from
the Latin, but owing to the vitality of our own native traditions we at
first borrowed nothing further; the syllabic character of the verse (so
far as it has been imported at all), came in only gradually, against
stubborn resistance; and it came not directly from the Latin, but
indirectly, through the French" (pp. <a class="xref" href="#Page_97">97</a>, <a class="xref" href="#Page_98">98</a>). Some of these statements
are open to question; but however we may interpret the French verse of
Wace and his contemporaries, it is obvious that in English the influence
of the Latin and the French poetry would very naturally be fused, with
no necessarily clear conception of definite verse-structure. Whether
under French or Latin influence, however, the new tendency was for the
more accurate counting of syllables. We may see some suggestion of this
in the verses of St. Godric, quoted on p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_126">126</a>, above, although they are
not regularly iambic. The poem on the "Eleven Pains of Hell" (in the
<i>Old English Miscellany</i>) shows the French influence clearly marked by
the language of its opening verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>This poem is sometimes said to show the first appearance of the
octosyllabic couplet in English. It suggests the struggle between native
indifference to syllable-counting and imitation of the greater
regularity of its models. As Dr. Morris says of the next specimen: "The
essence of the system of versification which the poet has adopted is,
briefly, that every line shall have four accented syllables in it, the
unaccented syllables being left in some measure, as it were, to take
care of themselves." But this does not altogether do justice to the new
regularity. Schipper says that of the first 100 lines of the poem 20 are
perfectly regular. (See his notes in vol. i. p. 109.) In the following
specimens we may trace the gradual growth of skill and accuracy.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<i>Lay of Havelok the Dane.</i> ll. 1-16. ab. 1300.)</p>

<p>For lays and romances, both French and English, the four-stress couplet
was an easy and favorite form. Compare the remarks of ten Brink: "We see
how the short couplet, which is the standing form of the court-romance,
was not only transmitted to it from the legendary, didactic, and
historical poems, but was also suggested to it by those songs to which
it was indebted for its own subject-matter. Other tokens indicate that a
short strophe composed of eight-syllabled lines, with single or
alternating rhymes, was a favorite form for many subjects in this
<i>jongleur</i> poetry.... The simple form of the short couplet offered to
the romance-poet no scope to compete in metrical technique with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> the
skilled court-lyrists. He could prove his art only within a limited
portion of this field: in the treatment of the <i>enjambement</i> and
particularly of rhyme. The poet strove not only to form pure rhymes, but
often to carry them forward with more syllables than were essential, and
he was fond of all sorts of grammatical devices in rhyme." (<i>English
Literature</i>, Kennedy trans., vol. i. pp. 174, 175.)</p>

<p>It was Gower and Chaucer, in the fourteenth century, who brought the use
of the eight-syllable couplet to the point of accuracy and perfection.
Gower made it the vehicle of the interminable narrative of the
<i>Confessio Amantis</i>, using it with regularity but with great monotony.
Chaucer transformed it into a much more flexible form (with freedom of
cesura, <i>enjambement</i>, and inversions), using it in about 3500 lines of
his poetry (excluding the translation of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>), but
early leaving it for the decasyllabic verse. In modern English poetry
this short couplet has rarely been used for continuous narrative of a
serious character, except by Byron and Wordsworth.</p>

<h3>II. FIVE-STRESS VERSE</h3>


<p>The five-stress or decasyllabic verse (iambic pentameter) is so much
more widely used in modern English poetry than any other verse-form,
that its history is of special interest. It is curious that a form so
completely adopted as the favorite of English verse should be borrowed
rather than native; but, the syllable-counting principle once being
admitted, there is nothing in five-stress verse inconsistent with native
English tendencies. A very great part of such verse has really only four
full accents, and this we have seen to be the number of accents in the
native English verse. On this point, see further remarks in connection
with the specimen from Spenser, p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_180">180</a> below.</p>

<p>This verse appears in two great divisions, rimed (the decasyllabic
couplet) and unrimed (blank verse). The rimed form was the earlier, the
unrimed being merely a modification of it under the influence of other
unrimed metres.</p>

<p>With Chaucer we have the first deliberate use of the five-stress
couplet, in continuous verse, known to English poetry. His earliest use
of the pentameter line was in the <i>Compleynt to Pitee</i> (perhaps written
about 1371), in the "rime royal" stanza; his earliest use of the
pentameter couplet was in the <i>Legend of Good Women</i>, usually dated
1385. From that time the measure became almost his only instrument, and
we find altogether in his poetry some 16,000 lines in the couplet,
besides some 14,000 more in rime royal. Too much praise cannot be given
Chaucer's use of the couplet. Although it was an experiment in English
verse, it has perhaps hardly been used since his time with greater
skill. He used a variety of cesuras (see ten Brink's monograph for the
enumeration of them), a very large number of feminine endings (such as
the still pronounced final-<i>e</i> and similar syllables easily provided),
free inversions in the first foot and elsewhere, and many run-on lines
(in a typical 100 lines some 16 run-on lines and 7 run-on couplets
appearing). The total effect is one of combined freedom and mastery, of
fluent conversational style yet within the limits of guarded artistic
form. "Much more regularly than the French and Proven&ccedil;als, and yet
without pedantic stiffness, he made his verse advance with a sort of
iambic gait, and he was therefore able to give up and exchange for a
freer arrangement the immovable cesura, which these poets had always
made to coincide with a foot-ending." (Ten Brink, in <i>English
Literature</i>, Kennedy trans., vol. ii. p. 48.) On Chaucer's verse, see,
besides the monograph of ten Brink already cited, Lounsbury's <i>Studies
in Chaucer</i>, vol. iii. pp. 297 ff., and Schipper, vol. i. pp. 442 ff.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The common assumption is, that Chaucer borrowed the pentameter couplet
directly from French poetry. On the history of this in France, see
Stengel, in Gr&ouml;ber's <i>Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The
decasyllabic verse was fairly common in France in the fourteenth century
(being called "<i>vers commun</i>" according to Stengel); but in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>the form of the couplet it was not. Professor Skeat says: "To say that
it [Chaucer's couplet] was derived from the French ten-syllable verse is
not a complete solution of the mystery; for nearly all such verse is
commonly either in stanzas, or else a great number of successive lines
are rimed together; and these, I believe, are rather scarce. After some
search I have, however, fortunately lighted upon a very interesting
specimen, among the poems of Guillaume de Machault, a French writer whom
Chaucer is known to have imitated, and who died in 1377. In the edition
of Machault's poems edited by Tarb&eacute;, Reims and Paris, 1849, p. 89, there
is a poem of exactly this character, of no great length, but fortunately
dated; for its title is 'Complainte &eacute;crite apr&egrave;s la bataille de Poitiers
et avant le si&egrave;ge de Reims par les Anglais' (1356-1358). The first four
lines run thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'A toy, Henry, dous amis, me complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pour ce que ne cueur ne mont ne plein;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Car a piet suy, sans cheval et sans selle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et si n'ay mais esmeraude, ne belle.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>... Now as Chaucer was taken prisoner in France in 1359, he had an
excellent opportunity for making himself acquainted with this poem, and
with others, possibly, in a similar metre, which have not come down to
us." (<i>The Prioress's Tale</i>, Introduction, pp. xix, xx.) Paris has shown
that the real date of the poem in question was 1340; the title quoted by
Skeat is Tarb&eacute;'s modern French caption. Professor Kittredge has called
my attention to the fact that there is another poem of Machault's in the
same metre (P. Paris's edition of <i>Voir-Dit</i>, p. 56), and also a poem by
Froissart, the "Orloge Amoureus."</p>

<p>Ten Brink calls attention to the possibility of the influence upon
Chaucer's couplet of the Italian hendecasyllabic verse. The <i>Compleynte
to Pitee</i>, it is true, was written probably before the Italian journey
of 1372-1373; but in Italy the "full significance" of the metre may have
become clear to Chaucer. "After that journey the heroic verse appears
almost exclusively as his poetic instrument.... Of still greater
significance is the fact that Chaucer's heroic verse differs from the
French decasyllabic in all the particulars in which the Italian
hendecasyllabic departs from the common source, and approaches the verse
of Dante and Boccaccio as closely as the metre of a Germanic language
can approach a Romance metre. It may be added also that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>the heroic
verse in the <i>Compleynte to Pitee</i> stands nearer the French decasyllabic
than that of the <i>Troilus</i> or the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>."</p>

<p>Dr. Lewis, on the other hand, in <i>The Foreign Sources of English
Versification</i>, would minimize the foreign sources of Chaucer's couplet.
Not only the unaccentual character of the French verse is opposed to the
theory of the French source, but also, he believes, the fixed cesura.
"In the English verse there is no such thing: indeed there is no cesura
at all, in the French sense of the word.... Schipper relegates to a
foot-note the suggestion that our heroic verse may have originated in a
different way, either through an abridgment of the alexandrine or
through an extension of the four-foot line. This is of course more
nearly the true view, but it is entirely immaterial which of the last
two explanations we hit upon. Accentual verses of four, six, and seven
feet were already familiar long before Chaucer's time. They exhibited a
more or less regular alternation of arsis and thesis. To devise a verse
which should be essentially the same in principle, but should have five
accents instead of four, six, or seven, was a task that Chaucer's genius
might well achieve unaided" (pp. 98, 99).</p>

<p>It is quite possible that a combination of all these views may be
nearest the truth. The objection to the French influence on the ground
of the syllabic (non-accentual) quality of the French verse does not
seem to be serious, since any imitation of French verse by an Englishman
would be likely to take on the accentual form; and, that once done, the
need for the fixed cesura would vanish. But it is worth while to
emphasize the fact that the genius of English verse was not so averse to
the formation of a decasyllabic five-stress line as to make it a serious
innovation. This view is further emphasized by the next specimen.</p></div>

<p>This specimen is properly not in five-stress verse, but in irregular
four-stress ("tumbling verse"); compare the specimen on p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_158">158</a>, above.
We have a close approach, however, to the regular five-stress verse, in
such lines as the fourth, fifth, eleventh, thirteenth, and seventeenth.
On this and similar passages in the <i>Shepherd's Calendar</i>, as
illustrating the close relation between the native measure and the newer
one, see an article by Professor Gummere, in the <i>American Journal of
Philology</i>, vol. vii. pp. 53ff. Other verses cited by Dr. Gummere are:</p>

<p>It is pointed out that the regular five-stress line, when having&mdash;as
very frequently&mdash;only four full stresses (two or three light syllables
coming together, especially at the pause), can hardly be distinguished
from certain forms of the native four-stress verse. See also the
Eclogues for February and August, in the <i>Shepherd's Calendar</i>. Dr.
Gummere's conclusion is, that "practically all the elements of
Anglo-Saxon verse are preserved in our modern poetry, though in
different combinations, with changed proportional importance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph Hall was the most vigorous satirist of the group of Elizabethans
who, in the last decade of the sixteenth century, were imitating the
satires of Horace, Juvenal, and Persius. Hall's satires have a curiously
eighteenth-century flavor, and his couplets are frequently very similar
to those of the age of Pope. Thus Thomas Warton (in his <i>History of
English Poetry</i>) observed of Hall that "the fabric of the couplets
approaches to the modern standard;" and Anderson, who edited the
<i>British Poets</i> in 1795, said: "Many of his lines would do honor to the
most harmonious of our modern poets. The sense has generally such a
pause, and will admit of such a punctuation at the close of the second
line, as if it were calculated for a modern ear." On the verse of these
Elizabethan satirists in general, see <i>The Rise of Formal Satire in
England</i>, by the present editor (<i>Publications of the Univ. of Penna</i>.).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, the verse of the satires of John Donne, from which
the following specimen is taken, is the roughest and most difficult of
all the satires of the group. The reputation of Donne's satires for
metrical ruggedness has affected unjustly that of his other poetry and
that of the Elizabethan satires in general. Dryden said: "Would not
Donne's Satires, which abound with so much wit, appear more charming if
he had taken care of his words and of his numbers?" (<i>Essay on Satire.</i>)
And Pope "versified" two of them, so as to bring them into a form
pleasing to the ear of his age.</p>

<p>The use of rimed couplets in Shakspere's dramas is especially
characteristic of his earlier work. In this play, <i>Love's Labor's Lost</i>,
Dowden says, "there are about two rhymed lines to every one of blank
verse" (<i>Shakspere Primer</i>, p. 44). In the late plays, on the other
hand, rime disappears almost altogether. It will be observed that while
Shakspere's heroic verse is usually fairly regular, with not very many
run-on lines, it yet differs in quality from that of satires. The
dramatic use moulds it into different cadences, and the single couplet
is, perhaps, less noticeably the unit of the verse.</p>

<p>Jonson is thought by some to have been the founder of the classical
school of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which made the
heroic couplet peculiarly its own. See on this subject an article by
Prof. F. E. Schelling, "Ben Jonson and the Classical School," in the
<i>Publications of the Modern Language Association</i>, n. s. vol. vi. p.
221. Professor Schelling finds in Jonson's verse all the characteristics
of the later couplet of Waller and Dryden: end-stopped lines and
couplets, a preference for medial cesura, and an antithetical structure
of the verse. "No better specimen of Jonson's antithetical manner could
be found," he says further, than the Epigram here quoted. So far as this
antithetical quality of Jonson's verse is concerned, Professor
Schelling's view cannot be questioned; but that Jonson shows any
singular preference for end-stopped lines and couplets may be seriously
questioned.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Waller</span>: <i>The Battle of the Summer Islands</i>, canto i. 1638.)</p>

<p>Edmund Waller is the chief representative of the early classical poetry
of the seventeenth century, and of the polishing and regulating of the
couplet which prepared the way for the verse of Dryden and Pope. The
dominant characteristic of this verse is its avoidance of <i>enjambement</i>,
or run-on lines, still more of run-on couplets. The growing precision of
French verse at the same time was perhaps influential in England.
Malherbe, who was at the French court after 1605, set rules for more
regular verse, and forbade, among other things, the use of run-on
lines&mdash;a precept which held good in French poetry until the nineteenth
century. The influence of Waller in England was, for a considerable
period, hardly less than that of Malherbe in France.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> Dryden said that
"the excellence and dignity" of rime "were never known till Mr. Waller
taught it; he first made writing easily an art; first showed us to
conclude the sense most commonly in distichs, which, in the verse of
those before him, runs on for so many lines together that the reader is
out of breath to overtake it. This sweetness of Mr. Waller's lyric poesy
was afterward followed, in the epic, by Sir John Denham, in his
<i>Cooper's Hill</i>." (Epistle Dedicatory of <i>The Rival Ladies</i>.) In another
place Dryden observed that only Waller, in English, had surpassed
Spenser in the harmony of his verse. Dryden's view was later echoed by
Pope, who exhorted his readers to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">"praise the easy vigor of a line<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Denham's strength and Waller's sweetness join."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="attrib">(<i>Essay on Criticism</i>, l. 360.)</p>

<p>But the most remarkable praise of Waller is found in the Preface to his
posthumous poems, 1690, generally attributed to Bishop Atterbury. "He
was indeed the parent of English verse, and the first that shewed us our
tongue had beauty and numbers in it.... The tongue came into his hands
like a rough diamond; he polished it first, and to that degree that all
artists since him have admired the workmanship, without pretending to
mend it.... He undoubtedly stands first in the list of refiners, and for
aught I know, last, too; for I question whether in Charles the Second's
reign English did not come to its full perfection; and whether it has
not had its Augustan Age, as well as the Latin.... We are no less
beholding to him for the new turn of verse, which he brought in, and the
improvement he made in our numbers. Before his time men rhymed, indeed,
and that was all: as for the harmony of measure, and that dance of words
which good ears are so much pleased with, they knew nothing of it. Their
poetry then was made up almost entirely of monosyllables, which, when
they come together in any cluster, are certainly the most harsh,
untunable things in the world. If any man doubts of this, let him read
ten lines in Donne, and he'll quickly be convinced. Besides, their
verses ran all into one another, and hung together, throughout a whole
copy, like the <i>hook't atoms</i> that compose a body in Des Cartes. There
was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> distinction of parts, no regular stops, nothing for the ear to
rest upon. But as soon as the copy began, down it went like a larum,
incessantly; and the reader was sure to be out of breath before he got
to the end of it. So that really verse in those days was but downright
prose, tagged with rhymes. Mr. Waller removed all these faults, brought
in more polysyllables and smoother measures, bound up his thoughts
better and in a cadence more agreeable to the nature of the verse he
wrote in: so that wherever the natural stops of that were, he contrived
the little breakings of his sense so as to fall in with 'em. And for
that reason, since the stress of our verse lies commonly upon the last
syllable, you'll hardly ever find him using a word of no force
there."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Waller's editor thus clearly discerns the very
characteristics of his verse which are avoided by the master-poets&mdash;the
coincidence of phrase-pauses and verse-pauses, and regularity in the
placing of stress.</p>

<p>The most important discussion of the influence of Waller on English
poetry, and on the heroic couplet in particular, is found in Mr. Gosse's
book, <i>From Shakespeare to Pope</i>. Mr. Gosse regards Waller as inventing
for himself the couplet of the classical school; "master," in 1623, of
such verse as "was not imitated by a single poet for nearly twenty
years" (p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_50">50</a>). This view is criticised in an interesting article by Dr.
Henry Wood, in the <i>American Journal of Philology</i>, vol. xi. p. 55.
While Mr. Gosse places Waller's earliest couplets in 1621 and 1623, Dr.
Wood would date them as late as 1626, and shows that Waller wrote
nothing else until 1635. Meantime had appeared (the first volume at
least as early as 1623) the translation of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, by
George Sandys, in which, says Wood, all the characteristics of Waller's
verse appear. "At all events," is his conclusion, "it was Sandys, and
not Waller, who at the beginning of the third decade of the century,
first of all Englishmen, made a uniform practice of writing in heroic
couplets, which are, on the whole, in accord with the French rule, and
which, for exactness of construction, and for harmonious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> sification, go
far towards satisfying the demands of the later 'classical' school in
England." Dr. Wood emphasizes the probable influence of the French poets
on these early heroic couplets, calling attention to the fact that
Sandys was in France in 1610. There is no evidence, however, that he was
there for more than a few days, <i>en route</i> to more eastern countries.
Waller was not in France till 1643. The whole question of the influence
of French poetry in England before the Restoration still remains to be
carefully investigated. Meantime, the cautious student will hesitate to
put too much stress on any single point of departure for the new style
of versification. Many influences must have combined to make it popular.
We have seen Professor Schelling emphasizing the influence of Jonson; he
also very justly points out "that it is a mistake to consider that the
Elizabethans often practised the couplet with the freedom, not to say
license, that characterizes its nineteenth century use in the hands of
such poets as Keats." Compare the couplets of even so romantic a poet as
Marlowe, in the specimen given above from <i>Hero and Leander</i>. And even
Mr. Gosse, in partial divergence from the doctrines of <i>From Shakespeare
to Pope</i>, says of the satiric verse of the Elizabethan Rowlands: "There
are lines in this passage which Pope would not have disdained to use. It
might, indeed, be employed as against that old heresy, not even yet
entirely discarded, that smoothness of heroic verse was the invention of
Waller. As a matter of fact, this, as well as all other branches of the
universal art of poetry, was understood by the great Elizabethan
masters; and if they did not frequently employ it, it was because they
left to such humbler writers as Rowlands an instrument incapable of
those noble and audacious harmonies on which they chiefly prided
themselves." (Introduction to the <i>Works of Rowlands</i>, Hunterian Club
ed., p. 16.)</p>

<p>A tribute to the incoming influence of the couplet is cited by Dr. Wood
from the poems of Sir John Beaumont (1582-1627). In his verses <i>To His
Late Majesty, concerning the True Forme of English Poetry</i>, Beaumont
said:</p>

<p>"Oldham was the first," says Mr. Gosse, "to liberate himself, in the use
of the distich, from this under-current of a stanza, and to write heroic
verse straight on, couplet by couplet, ascending by steady strides and
not by irregular leaps. (Any one who will venture to read Oldham's
disagreeable <i>Satire upon the Jesuits</i>, written in 1679, will see the
truth of this remark, and note the effect that its versification had
upon that series of Dryden's satires which immediately followed it.) In
Pope's best satires we see this art carried to its final perfection;
after his time the connecting link between couplet and couplet became
lost, and at last in the decline poems became, as some one has said,
mere cases of lancets lying side by side. But in Dryden's day the
connection was still only too obvious, and it strikes me that it may
have been from a consciousness of this defect, that Dryden adopted that
triplet, with a final alexandrine, which he is so fond of introducing."

<p>Dryden was the first great English poet after Chaucer to make the heroic
couplet his chief vehicle of expression, and he put far more variety and
vigor into it than had been achieved by his nearer predecessors. As Pope
said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The varying verse, the full resounding line,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The long majestic march, the energy divine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="attrib">(<i>Epistle ii.</i>, 267.)</p>

<p>And Gray, some years later, symbolized Dryden's couplet in these fine
lines of the <i>Progress of Poesy</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Wide o'er the fields of glory bear<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Two coursers of ethereal race,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With necks in thunder clothed, and long-resounding pace."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On Dryden's development of the couplet, see especially Saintsbury's
<i>Life of Dryden</i> (English Men of Letters Series), pp. 17, 171. "The
whole structure of the decasyllabic line before the middle of the
seventeenth century was ill calculated for the perfecting of the
couplet. Accustomed either to the stately plainness of blank verse, or
to the elaborate intricacies of the stanza, writers had got into the
habit of communicating to their verse a slow and somewhat languid
movement." (p. 17.) "In versification the great achievement of Dryden
was the alteration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> of what may be called the balance of the line,
causing it to run more quickly, and to strike its rhymes with a sharper
and less prolonged sound. One obvious means of obtaining this was, as a
matter of course, the isolation of the couplet, and the avoidance of
overlapping the different lines one upon the other. The effect of this
overlapping, by depriving the eye and voice of the expectation of rest
at the end of each couplet, is always one of two things. Either the
lines are converted into a sort of rhythmic prose, made musical by the
rhymes rather than divided by them, or else a considerable pause is
invited at the end of each, or of most lines, and the cadence of the
whole becomes comparatively slow and languid. Both these forms, as may
be seen in the works of Mr. Morris, as well as in the older writers, are
excellently suited for narration of some considerable length. They are
less well suited for satire, for argument, and for the moral reflections
which the age of Dryden loved. He therefore set himself to elaborate the
couplet with its sharp point, its quick delivery, and the pistol-like
detonation of its rhyme. But there is an obvious objection, or rather
there are several obvious objections which present themselves to the
couplet. It was natural that to one accustomed to the more varied range
of the older rhythm and metre, there might seem to be a danger of the
snip-snap monotony into which, as we know, it did actually fall when it
passed out of the hands of its first great practitioners. There might
also be a fear that it would not always be possible to compress the
sense of a complete clause within the narrow limits of twenty syllables.
To meet these difficulties Dryden resorted to three mechanical
devices&mdash;the hemistich, the alexandrine, and the triplet, all three of
which could be used indifferently to eke out the space or to give
variety of sound.... In poetry proper the hemistich is anything but
pleasing, and Dryden, becoming convinced of the fact, almost discarded
it. The alexandrine and the triplet he always continued to use." (pp.
171, 172.)</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Dryden</span>: <i>Marriage &agrave; la Mode</i>, II, i. 1672.)</p>

<p>The use of the heroic couplet in the drama marks its effort to conquer
the last citadel of English poetry; an attempt which, under the
leadership of Dryden, seemed to succeed, but soon gave way to better
judgment. Dryden favored the experiment in the Preface to <i>The Rival
Ladies</i> (1663), and inserted a few couplets in that play. Etheredge
accepted the suggestion, and put the serious parts of <i>The Comical
Revenge</i> (largely prose) into couplets, in 1664. In the same year <i>The
Indian Queen</i> (by Dryden and Sir Robert Howard) appeared in heroic
verse, and the fashion soon became so general that in the <i>Essay on
Heroic Plays</i>, prefixed to <i>The Conquest of Granada</i> (1672), Dryden
could say: "Whether Heroic Verse ought to be admitted into serious
plays, is not now to be disputed: 'tis already in possession of the
stage; and I dare confidently affirm, that very few tragedies, in this
age, shall be received without it." Only six years later, however, in
1678, he returned to blank verse in <i>All for Love</i>, saying: "I have
disencumbered myself from rhyme. Not that I condemn my former way, but
that this is more proper to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> present purpose." In all about five
plays of Dryden's are in couplets; after 1678 he rarely returned to rime
for the drama. As Atterbury said in his Preface to Waller's poems:
"'Twas the strength of his genius that first brought it into credit in
plays; and 'tis the force of his example that has thrown it out again."
"The fashion of rhyme in the drama, then, to be exact," says Mr. Gosse,
"flourished from 1664 until ... 1678." Some justification for its use is
to be found in the wretched condition into which blank verse had fallen.
"The blank iambics of the romantic dramatists had become so execrably
weak and distended, the whole movement of dramatic verse had grown so
flaccid, that a little restraint in the severe limits of rhyme was
absolutely necessary." (Gosse, in <i>Seventeenth Century Studies</i>, p.
264.)</p>

<p>The present specimen is from a play in which the couplet was used but
slightly; but it shows Dryden's use of it at its best. In the drama, as
already remarked, the couplet is naturally less epigrammatic and pointed
than in didactic and satiric verse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For the arguments with which Dryden defended the use of rime in the
drama, see the Preface to <i>The Rival Ladies</i>, the <i>Essay of Heroic
Plays</i>, the <i>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</i>, and the <i>Defence of an Essay of
Dramatic Poesy</i>. "In the quickness of reparties (which in discoursive
scenes fall very often), it has so particular a grace, and is so aptly
suited to them, that the sudden smartness of the answer, and the
sweetness of the rhyme, set off the beauty of each other. But that
benefit which I consider most in it, because I have not seldom found it,
is, that it bounds and circumscribes the fancy." (<i>Essays of Dryden</i>,
ed. W. P. Ker, vol. i. p. 8.) In the <i>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</i>, Crites,
representing Sir Robert Howard, opposes the use of rime on the ground of
Aristotle's dictum that tragedy is best written in the kind of verse
which is nearest prose. A play being an imitation of Nature, "the nearer
anything comes to the imitation of it, the more it pleases." Neander,
representing Dryden, answers that this line of argument will equally
forbid blank verse. Blank verse is "properly but measured prose"; and
rime may be "made as natural as blank verse, by the well placing of the
words, etc." "But I need not go so far to prove that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>rhyme, as it
succeeds to all other offices of Greek and Latin verse, so especially to
this of plays, since the custom of all nations at this day confirms it,
all the French, Italian, and Spanish tragedies are generally writ in it;
and sure the universal consent of the most civilized parts of the world
ought in this, as it doth in other customs, to include the rest."
(<i>Ibid.</i> p. 98.) Again, while a play is a representation of Nature, it
is "Nature wrought up to an higher pitch"; and for this purpose "heroic
rhyme is nearest Nature, as being the noblest kind of modern verse."
(pp. 100, 101.) In the <i>Essay of Heroic Plays</i> Dryden again summarizes
the case for the other side by saying that "all the arguments which are
formed against it can amount to no more than this, that it is not so
near conversation as prose, and therefore not so natural. But it is very
clear to all who understand Poetry, that serious plays ought not to
imitate conversation too nearly." If, therefore, we begin to leave the
mere "imitation of ordinary converse," we should go on consistently to
"the last perfection of Art. It was only custom which cozened us so
long; we thought, because Shakespeare and Fletcher went no farther, that
there the pillars of poetry were to be erected; that, because they
excellently described passion without rhyme, therefore rhyme was not
capable of describing it. But time has now convinced most men of that
error." (<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 148, 149.)</p>

<p>Dryden was of course quite right in objecting to the claim that
imaginative poetry ought to seek the form closest to the language of
real life. The real question is whether rimed verse is a more
imaginative and highly poetic form than blank verse; modern opinion
would unanimously answer in the negative.</p>

<p>It strikes a modern reader as curious that Dryden and his contemporaries
should have advocated the use of rime in tragedy rather than in comedy;
but we have the clew to their feeling in the saying that "<i>serious
plays</i> ought not to imitate conversation too nearly." In the Restoration
period the comedy was thought of as a realistic representation of life;
hence its characters should speak in natural prose, as they have
continued to do, for the most part, ever since. The tragedy or heroic
play, on the other hand, was in the region of artistic convention, much
farther removed from reality; hence its language was to be "raised above
the life." This distinction between the range of comedy and that of
tragedy, which would have seemed strange to the Elizabethans, explains
the widely diverging lines which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> find the two forms of the drama
following from the time of the Restoration.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Pope</span>: <i>Iliad</i>, bk. xii.)</p>

<p>Pope's couplet, while less vigorous and varied than Dryden's, has been
generally considered the most perfect development of the typical measure
of the classical school. Mr. Courthope thinks that in this speech from
the <i>Iliad</i>, Pope "perhaps attains the highest level of which the heroic
couplet is capable." (<i>Works of Pope</i>, vol. v. p. 167.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What he learned from Dryden," Mr. Courthope says in another place, "was
the art of expressing the social and conversational idiom of the
language in a metrical form. His conception of metrical harmony was,
however, altogether different from his professed master's, and rather
resembled that of Sandys, whose translation of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> he
told Spence he had read when very young, and with the greatest delight.
He explains the system in a letter to Cromwell, dated November 25, 1710.</p>

<p>"'(1) As to the hiatus, it is certainly to be avoided as often as
possible; but on the other hand, since the reason of it is only for the
sake of the numbers, so if, to avoid it, we incur another fault against
their smoothness, methinks the very end of that nicety is destroyed....</p>

<p>"'(2) I would except against the use of all expletives in verse, as <i>do</i>
before verbs plural, or even the frequent use of <i>did</i> or <i>does</i> to
change the termination of the rhyme....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"'(3) Monosyllable lines, unless very artfully managed, are stiff,
languishing, and hard.</p>

<p>"'(4) The repeating the same rhymes within four or six lines of each
other, which tire the ear with too much of the like sound.</p>

<p>"'(5) The too frequent use of alexandrines, which are never graceful,
but where there is some majesty added to the verse by them, or when
there cannot be found a word in them but what is absolutely needful.</p>

<p>"'(6) Every nice ear must, I believe, have observed that in any smooth
English verse of ten syllables, there is naturally a pause either at the
fourth, fifth, or sixth syllables.... Now I fancy that, to preserve an
exact harmony and variety, none of these pauses should be continued
above three lines together, without the interposition of another; else
it will be apt to weary the ear with one continued tone.'"</p>

<p>(<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 20, 21.)</p>

<p>Here are implied all the characteristics of the Popean couplet. The
cesura is to vary, but not from a fundamentally medial position. The
avoidance of <i>enjambement</i> is not mentioned, doubtless because it is
assumed as an essential of couplets professing any degree of
correctness.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lang protests against the monotony of the verse of Pope's
<i>Iliad</i> in some lines which cleverly adopt the same sort of measure:</p>

<p>"The heroic couplet," says Mr. Gosse, "was never employed, even by Pope
himself, with more melody than by Goldsmith in this poem." (<i>Eighteenth
Century Literature</i>, p. 320.) Its use at this time, when the revival of
blank verse by Thomson and others had seriously affected the prestige of
the couplet, was a sign of Goldsmith's reactionary tendency toward the
school of Pope. His dislike of blank verse he expressed in his early
work on the <i>Present State of Polite Learning</i>, saying that it might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
reckoned among "several disagreeable instances of pedantry" lately
proceeding "from a desire in the critic of grafting the spirit of
ancient languages upon the English." (<i>Works</i>, Globe ed., p. 439.) This
opinion was of course shared by Goldsmith's friend, Dr. Johnson, whose
two important poems (<i>London</i> and <i>The Vanity of Human Wishes</i>) stand
with the two of Goldsmith as the last notable pieces of English poetry
of the classical school. While Johnson admitted that he could not "wish
that Milton had been a rhymer," yet he never lost an opportunity to
speak contemptuously of blank verse as a poetic form, and quoted
approvingly the saying of a critic that it "seems to be verse only to
the eye." (<i>Life of Milton.</i>)</p>

characteristic reticence and vigor. Professor Woodberry praises them in
an interesting passage on "the old heroic rhymed couplet, that simplest
form of English verse music, which could rise, nevertheless, to the
almost lyric loftiness of the last lines of the <i>Dunciad</i>; so supple and
flexible; made for easy simile and compact metaphor; lending itself so
perfectly to the sudden flash of wit or turn of humor; the natural shell
of an epigram; compelling the poet to practice all the virtues of
brevity; checking the wandering fancy, and repressing the secondary
thought; requiring in a masterly use of it the employment of more mental
powers than any other metrical form; despised and neglected now because
the literature which is embodied in it is despised and neglected, yet
the best metrical form which intelligence, as distinct from poetical
feeling, can employ." (<i>Makers of Literature</i>, p. 104.)</p>

<p>Of this poem Mr. C. H. Herford says: "<i>The Story of Rimini</i> is the
starting-point of that free or Chaucerian treatment of the heroic
couplet, and of the colloquial style, eschewing epigram and full of
familiar turns, which Shelley in <i>Julian and Maddalo</i> and Keats in
<i>Lamia</i> made classical." (<i>Age of Wordsworth</i>, p. 83.) The treatment of
the couplet is still characterized by but slight use of run-on lines,
and a preference for the medial cesura; but on the other hand there is a
large degree of freedom in the inversion of accents and other
alterations of the regular stress. Compare the last line of the present
specimen, and such other lines as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Of crimson cloths hanging a hand of snow."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Some, with a drag, dangling from the cap's crest."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"'Who's there?' said that sweet voice, kindly and clear."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"The other with the tears streaming down both his cheeks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last of these lines, an alexandrine, is also characteristic. Hunt
imitated Dryden in the use of both alexandrine and triplet. Of the
latter he said: "I confess I like the very bracket that marks out the
triplet to the reader's eye, and prepares him for the music of it. It
has a look like the bridge of a lute." (Preface to <i>Works</i>, 1832.) Mr.
A. J. Kent, in an article in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, says of Leigh
Hunt that "he became the greatest master since the days of Dryden" of
the heroic couplet. (1881, p. 224.)</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Keats</span>: <i>Endymion</i>, ll. 1-24. 1818.)</p>

<p>In the couplet of Keats, and of a number of his successors, we have a
really different measure from the "heroic couplet" proper. The
individual line and the couplet alike cease to be prominent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> units of
the verse. The effect is therefore closely allied to that of blank
verse; the rimes, not being emphasized by marked pauses, serving rather
as means of tone color than as organizers of the verse. See Mr.
Saintsbury's remarks (quoted in the notes on Dryden, p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_195">195</a>, above), on
"lines made musical by the rhymes rather than divided by them." In like
manner Mr. Symonds says that "the couplets of Marlowe, Fletcher,
Shelley, and Keats follow the laws of blank verse, and add rhyme&mdash;that
is to say, their periods and pauses are entirely determined by the
sense." (<i>Blank Verse</i>, p. 66.) This is true of the couplets of Shelley
and Keats, and to a less degree of those of Fletcher's <i>Faithful
Shepherdess</i>, but will hardly apply to Marlowe, nor, as we have seen, to

<h4>B.&mdash;BLANK VERSE</h4>

<p>Unrimed five-stress verse early became the accepted form for English
dramatic poetry, and in the modern English period has become the
favorite form for long continuous poems, narrative and reflective as
well. In general, as will appear from the specimens, it is marked not
only by the absence of rime but by a prevalent freedom of structure
rarely found in the couplet.</p>

<p>The impetus toward the writing of blank verse seems to have been given
by the influence of classical humanism, the representatives of which
grew sceptical as to the use of rime, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> ground that it was not
found in classical poetry. In Italy Giovanni Trissino wrote his
<i>Sophonisbe</i> and <i>Italia Liberata</i> (1515-1548) in rimeless verses, and
was looked upon as the inventor of <i>versi sciolti</i>, <i>i.e.</i> verses
"freed" from rime. (See Schipper, vol. ii. p. 4.) See also below, in the
notes on Surrey, and later under Imitations of Classical Verse, for
notes on the same movement.</p>

<p>On the nature of English blank verse, see J. A. Symonds's <i>Blank Verse</i>
(1895), a reprint of essays in the Appendix to his <i>Sketches and Studies
in Southern Europe</i>. In his <i>Chapters on English Metre</i> (chap. iv.), Mr.
J. B. Mayor criticises what he calls Mr. Symonds's "&aelig;sthetic
intuitivism."</p>

<p>On the early history of English blank verse, see the article by Schr&ouml;er,
<i>Anf&auml;nge des Blankverses in England, Anglia</i>, vol. iv. p. 1, and Mr. G.
C. Macaulay's <i>Francis Beaumont</i>, pp. 39-49.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Symonds's remarks on the general nature of blank verse the
following are especially interesting: "English blank verse is perhaps
more various and plastic than any other national metre. It is capable of
being used for the most commonplace and the most sublime utterances....
Originally instituted for the drama, it received in Milton's hands an
epical treatment, and has by authors of our own day been used for
idyllic and even for lyrical compositions. Plato mentions a Greek
musical instrument called <i>panharmonion</i>, which was adapted to express
the different modes and systems of melodious utterance. This name might
be applied to our blank verse; there is no harmony of sound, no dignity
of movement, no swiftness, no subtlety of languid sweetness, no brevity,
no force of emphasis, beyond its scope." (<i>Blank Verse</i>, pp. 16, 17.)</p>

<p>"It seems adapted specially for thought in evolution; it requires
progression and sustained effort. As a consequence of this, its melody
is determined by the sense which it contains, and depends more upon
proportion and harmony of sounds than upon recurrences and regularities
of structure.... Another point about blank verse is that it admits of no
mediocrity; it must be either clay or gold.... Hence, we find that blank
verse has been the metre of genius, that it is only used success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>fully
by indubitable poets, and that it is no favorite in a mean, contracted,
and unimaginative age. The freedom of the renaissance created it in
England. The freedom of our century has reproduced it. Blank verse is a
type and symbol of our national literary spirit&mdash;uncontrolled by
precedent or rule, inclined to extravagance, yet reaching perfection at
intervals by an inner force and <i>vivida vis</i> of native inspiration."
(<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 70-72.)</p>

<p>The earliest use of the term "blank verse," noted in the <i>New English
Dictionary</i>, is in Nash's Preface to Greene's <i>Menaphon</i>, 1589: "the
swelling bumbast of bragging blanke verse." Some ten years later
Shakspere used it in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, V. ii., where Benedick
speaks of those heroes "whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of
blank verse," but will not rime easily. In Chapman's <i>All Fools</i> (1605)
the young gallant, in describing his manifold accomplishments, says he
could write</p>

verse. (See Henry Morley's <i>First Sketch of English Literature</i>, p. 294,
and his <i>English Writers</i>, vol. viii. p. 61.) The verse of Surrey, like
Wyatt's, shows a somewhat mechanical adherence to the syllable-counting
principle, in contrast to regard for accents.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Thus we find such

<p>This tragedy, although Dryden curiously instanced it in defence of the
use of rime on the stage, was the earliest English drama in blank verse.
The metre is decidedly more monotonous than Surrey's, and gives little
hint of the possibilities of the measure for dramatic expression. In
general, the early experiments in blank verse suggest&mdash;what they must
often have seemed to their writers&mdash;the mere use of the decasyllabic
couplet deprived of its rime. Nevertheless, as Mr. Symonds remarks of a
passage in <i>Gorboduc</i>, "we yet may trace variety and emphasis in the
pauses of these lines beyond what would at that epoch have been possible
in sequences of rhymed couplets." (<i>Blank Verse</i>, p. 20.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Marlowe is universally and rightly regarded as the first English poet
who used blank verse with the hand of a master, and showed its
possibilities. With him it became practically a new measure. Mr. Symonds
says: "He found the ten-syllabled heroic line monotonous, monosyllabic,
and divided into five feet of tolerably regular alternate short and
long. He left it various in form and structure, sometimes redundant by a
syllable, sometimes deficient, enriched with unexpected emphases and
changes in the beat. He found no sequence or attempt at periods; one
line succeeded another with insipid regularity, and all were made after
the same model. He grouped his verse according to the sense, obeying an
internal law of melody, and allowing the thought contained in his words
to dominate their form....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> Used in this fashion, blank verse became a
Proteus. It resembled music, which requires regular time and rhythm;
but, by the employment of phrase, induces a higher kind of melody to
rise above the common and despotic beat of time.... It is true that,
like all great poets, he left his own peculiar imprint on it, and that
his metre is marked by an almost extravagant exuberance, impetuosity,
and height of coloring." (<i>Blank Verse</i>, pp. 22-27.) In the earlier
verse of <i>Tamburlaine</i>, while showing these new qualities of a metrical
master, Marlowe yet kept pretty closely to the individual, end-stopped
line; in his later verse, as illustrated in the fragmentary text of
<i>Faustus</i>, he seems to have attained much more freedom, resembling that
of the later plays of Shakspere.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>This Mr. Symonds cites as "a single instance of the elasticity,
self-restraint, and freshness of the Shaksperian blank verse; of its
freedom from Marlowe's turgidity, or Fletcher's languor, or Milton's
involution; of its ringing sound and lucid vigor.... It illustrates the
freedom from adventitious ornament and the organic continuity of
Shakspere's versification, while it also exhibits his power of varying
his cadences and suiting them to the dramatic utterance of his
characters." (<i>Blank Verse</i>, p. 31.)</p>

<p>No attempt can be made to represent adequately the blank verse of
Shakspere. The specimens, chosen respectively from his earlier, middle,
and later periods, illustrate the trend of development of his verse. In
the earlier period it was characterized by the slight use of feminine
endings and <i>enjambement</i>; in the later by marked preference for both,
and by general freedom and flexibility. In other words, Shakspere's own
development represents, in a sort of miniature, that of the history of
dramatic blank verse. According to Furnivall's tables, the proportion of
run-on lines to end-stopped lines in <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> is
one in ten, while in <i>The Tempest</i> it is one in three. The increased use
of "light" and "weak" endings is closely analogous. Professor Wendell
says of the verse of <i>Cymbeline</i>: "End-stopped lines are so deliberately
avoided that one feels a sense of relief when a speech and a line end
together. Such a phrase as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'How slow his soul sail'd on, how swift his ship'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is deliberately made, not a single line, but two half-lines. Several
times, in the broken dialogue, one has literally to count the syllables
before the metrical regularity of the verse appears....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> Clearly this
puzzling style is decadent; the distinction between verse and prose is

<p>Jonson's blank verse, says Mr. Symonds, is that "of a scholar&mdash;pointed,
polished, and free from the lyricisms of his age. It lacks harmony and
is often labored; but vigorous and solid it never fails to be." He also
instances the opening lines of the <i>Sad Shepherd</i> as exceptional in
their "delicate music." Beaumont's verse is in many ways similar in
structure to Jonson's, yet commonly more melodious.</p>

<p>The verse of Fletcher is highly individual among the Jacobean
dramatists, though in a sense typical of the breaking down of blank
verse, in the direction of prose, which was going on at this period. The
distinguishing feature of Fletcher's verse is the constant use of
feminine endings, and the extension of these to triple and even
quadruple endings, by the addition of one or more syllables.
Twelve-syllable lines (not alexandrines, but ordinary lines with triple
endings) are not at all uncommon; and the additional syllable or
syllables may even be emphatic. In general the tendency was in the
direction of the freedom of conversational prose. Such a line as</p>

<p>Massinger's verse is more regular than that of Fletcher and others, in

an error to assume that there was no good blank verse written in this
period when the drama in general is said to have been in a state of
"decadence." The verse of Ford, for example, is noticeably strong and
restrained (compare the remark of Mr. Symonds, on its "glittering
regularity"). On the other hand, one may see the dramas of Richard Brome
for specimens of the decadent metre at its worst. Brome wrote comedies
both in prose and verse, and there is little difference between the two
forms in his hands. See also the crude and lax verse of some of the
early plays of Dryden, illustrated on p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_234">234</a> below. It was verse of this
kind which, as Mr. Gosse observes, justified the introduction of the

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Milton</span>: <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, ll. 1636-1652. 1671.)</p>

<p>The blank verse of Milton is characterized by greater freedom and
flexibility than that of any earlier poet. The single line practically
ceases to be the unit of the verse, which is divided rather into
metrical paragraphs, or, as some would even call them, stanzas.
Professor Corson quotes an interesting passage from a letter of
Coleridge, giving an account of a conversation in which Wordsworth
expressed his view of this sort of blank verse. "My friend gave his
definition and notion of harmonious verse, that it consisted (the
English iambic blank verse above all) in the apt arrangement of pauses
and cadences, and the sweep of whole paragraphs,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">with many a winding bout<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of linked sweetness long drawn out,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and not in the even flow, much less in the prominence or antithetic
vigor of single lines, which were indeed injurious to the total effect,
except where they were introduced for some specific purpose." (Corson's
<i>Primer of English Verse</i>, p. 218.) In like manner Mr. Symonds says:
"The most sonorous passages begin and end with interrupted lines,
including in one organic structure, periods, parentheses, and paragraphs
of fluent melody.... In these structures there are many pauses which
enable the ear and voice to rest themselves, but none are perfect, none
satisfy the want created by the opening hemistich, until the final and
deliberate close is reached." (<i>Blank Verse</i> pp. 56, 57.)</p>

<p>In Milton's own prefatory note to <i>Paradise Lost</i>, he called his blank
verse "English heroic verse without rime." Rime he spoke of as "the
invention of a barbarous age, ... graced indeed since by the use of some
famous modern poets,"&mdash;not least among them, he might have said, being
John Milton himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> He described also the special character of his
verse in saying that "true musical delight ... consists only in apt
numbers, fit quantity of syllables, and the sense variously drawn out
from one verse into another,"&mdash;that is, by <i>enjambement</i>. "This neglect
then of rime so little is to be taken for a defect, ... that it rather
is to be esteemed an example set, the first in English, of ancient
liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage
of riming."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>It appears from this note that Milton regarded his heroic blank verse as
a different measure from the familiar dramatic blank verse. The latter
he used in <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, the verse-structure of which will be seen
to differ from that of <i>Paradise Lost</i>; the most salient distinction is
the more frequent use of feminine endings. Mr. Symonds remarks
interestingly on the "difference between Shaksperian and Miltonic,
between dramatic and epical blank verse. The one is simple in
construction and progressive, the other is complex and stationary....
The one exhibits a thought, in the process of formation, developing
itself from the excited fancy of the speaker. The other presents to us
an image crystallized and perfect in the poet's mind; the one is in
time, the other in space&mdash;the one is a growing and the other a complete
organism.... The one, if we may play upon a fancy, resembles Music, and
the other Architecture." (<i>Blank Verse</i>, p. 58.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these specimens of Dryden's blank verse illustrates the
loose form of it found in many of the comedies, ill distinguished from
prose and used interchangeably with prose, as in the case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> of the late
Jacobean dramatists. It was with <i>All for Love</i> that Dryden dropped the
use of the rimed couplet in tragedy, and turned his hand toward the
construction of really noble blank verse. This play was professedly an
imitation of Shakspere, and the passage here quoted is a paraphrase of
one in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, II. ii. Shakspere's blank verse doubtless
exerted a good influence on the quality of Dryden's. "From this time
on," says Mr. Gosse, "Dryden's blank verse was more severe than any
which had been used, except by Milton, since Ben Jonson." (<i>Eighteenth
Century Literature</i>, p. 14.)</p>

<p>This poem was one of those connected with the revival of blank verse,
for didactic poetry, near the middle of the eighteenth century. Of
Blair's verse Mr. Saintsbury says that it "is by no means to be
despised. Technically its only fault is the use and abuse of the
redundant syllable. The quality ... is in every respect rather moulded
upon dramatic than upon purely poetical models, and he shows little
trace of imitation either of Milton, or of his contemporary, Thomson."

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Thomson</span>: <i>The Seasons; Winter</i>. 1726.)</p>

<p>Thomson's <i>Seasons</i> was undoubtedly the most influential of the poems of
the blank-verse revival of this period. Saintsbury says: "His blank
verse in especial cannot receive too much commendation. With that of
Milton, and that of the present Poet Laureate [Tennyson], it must rank
as one of the chief original models of the metre to be found in English
poetry." (Ward's <i>English Poets</i>, vol. iii. p. 169.)</p>

<p>Other influential poems of the same period, written in blank verse, were
Glover's <i>Leonidas</i> (1737), Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i> (1742-1744), and
Akenside's <i>Pleasures of the Imagination</i> (1744). Much earlier than
these had come the curious poem of John Philips on <i>Cider</i> (1708).
Philips is praised by Thomson as the successor of Milton in some lines
of <i>Autumn</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Philips, Pomona's bard, the second thou<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who nobly durst, in rhyme-unfetter'd verse<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In general, the blank verse of all these poets shows the influence of
the couplet and lacks flexibility. Thus Mr. Symonds says: "The use of
the couplet had unfitted poets for its composition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> Their acquired
canons of regularity, when applied to loose and flowing metre, led them
astray.... Hence it followed, that when blank verse began again to be
written, it found itself very much at the point where it had stood
before the appearance of Marlowe. Even Thomson ... wrote stiff and
languid blank verse with monosyllabic terminations and monotonous
cadences&mdash;a pedestrian style." (<i>Blank Verse</i>, pp. 61, 62.)<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Cowper</span>: <i>The Task</i>, book VI. ll. 295-320. 1785.)</p>

<p>"The blank verse of Cowper's <i>Task</i> is admirably adapted to the theme,"
says Professor Corson. "Cowper saw farther than any one before him had
seen, into the secrets of the elaborate music of Milton's blank verse,
and availed himself of those secrets to some extent&mdash;to as far an extent
as the simplicity of his themes demanded." (<i>Primer of English Verse</i>,
p. 221.) Professor Ward speaks, however, of the "lumbering movement" of
Cowper's blank verse as being in contrast to "the neatness and ease of
his rhymed couplets." (<i>English Poets</i>, vol. iii. p. 432.) Cowper prided
himself, not without reason, on the individuality of his blank verse. In
a letter to the Rev. John Newton (Dec. 11, 1784) he said: "Milton's
manner was peculiar. So is Thomson's. He that should write like either
of them, would, in my judgment, deserve the name of a copyist, but not
of a poet.... Blank verse is susceptible of a much greater
diversification of manner than verse in rhyme: and why the modern
writers of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> have all thought proper to cast their numbers alike, I
know not." In another letter (to Lady Hesketh, March 20, 1786) Cowper
reveals his careful study of Milton's verse: "When the sense requires
it, or when for the sake of avoiding a monotonous cadence of the lines,
of which there is always danger in so long a work, it shall appear to be
prudent, I still leave a verse behind me that has some uneasiness in its
formation. It is not possible to read <i>Paradise Lost</i>, with an ear for
harmony, without being sensible of the great advantage which Milton drew
from such a management.... Uncritical readers find that they perform a
long journey through several hundred pages perhaps without weariness;
they find the numbers harmonious, but are not aware of the art by which
that harmony is brought to pass, much less suspect that a violation of
all harmony on some occasions is the very thing to which they are not a
little indebted for their gratification."</p>

<p>The blank verse of Tennyson is probably to be regarded as the most
masterly found among modern poets.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Its flexibility is almost
infinite, yet never unmelodious. The last of the specimens just quoted
illustrates his use of blank verse for short lyrical poems,&mdash;an unusual
and notable achievement. Perhaps only Collins's <i>Ode to Evening</i> can be
compared with his success in this direction, and Collins used a more
elaborate strophe to fill, in part, the place of rime. Of the unrimed
lyrics in <i>The Princess</i>, Mr. Symonds says that they "are perfect
specimens of most melodious and complete minstrelsy in words." In the
"Tears, Idle Tears," he goes on to say, the verse "is divided into
periods of five lines, each of which terminates with the words 'days
that are no more.' This recurrence of sound and meaning is a substitute
for rhyme, and suggests rhyme so persuasively that it is impossible to
call the poem mere blank verse." See also the specimens on p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_144">144</a> above.</p>

<p>In the case of both Tennyson and Browning the student should compare the
form of the narrative blank verse on the one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> hand with that of the
dramatic on the other. Yet in a sense all Browning's blank verse is
dramatic. It is no less flexible than Tennyson's, but (as in most of
Browning's poetry) sacrifices more of melody in adapting itself to the
thought.</p>

<p>Of some of Browning's blank verse Mr. Mayor observes: "The extreme
harshness of many of these lines is almost a match for anything in
Surrey, only what in Surrey is helplessness seems the perversity of
strength in Browning.... The Aristophanic vein in Browning is
continually leading him to trample under foot the dignity of verse and
to shock the uninitiated reader by colloquial familiarities, 'thumps
upon the back,' such as the poet Cowper resented; yet no one can be more
impressive than he is when he surrenders himself to the pure spirit of
poetry, and flows onward in a stream of glorious music, such as that in
which Balaustion pictures Athens overwhelmed by an advance of the sea
(<i>Aristophanes' Apology</i>, p. 2)." (<i>Chapters on English Metre</i>, 2d ed.,

<p>The blank verse of Stephen Phillips is the most important&mdash;one may say
perhaps the only important&mdash;that has been written since Tennyson's; and
it is of especial interest as forming an actual revival of the form on
the English stage. Aside from the dramas, it is seen at its best in
<i>Marpessa</i>. Imitating Milton, and at the same time handling the measure
with original force, Mr. Phillips introduces unusual cadences, for which
he has been severely reproached by the critics. Such lines as the
following are typical of these variations from the normal rhythm:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"O all fresh out of beautiful sunlight."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Agamemnon bowed over, and from his wheel."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"And to dispel shadows and shadowy fear."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"My bloom faded, and waning light of eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

of the Younger Generation</i>, pp. 313-327.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> One may easily find other instances of the sporadic
appearance of the same measure in the midst of irregular "long lines" or
rough alexandrines and septenaries. Compare, for example, the following,
from early plays in Manly's <i>Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama</i>:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"To be alone, nor very convenyent."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Ye shall not touche yt, for that I forbede."<br /></span>

<p>
The context of many of these lines shows that they were intended to be
read as four-stress rather than five-stress; but such examples serve to
make clear how easily English rhythm would fall into the decasyllabic
line.</p></div>

cesura, the avoidance of rime on weak syllables, the preservation of the
accent on the even-numbered syllables. (To some of these reforms, as has
been indicated, there are not a few exceptions.) In like manner ten
Brink observes that Surrey "is more successful than Wyatt in adapting
foreign rules to the rhythmical accent of the English language, and thus
he is in reality the founder of the New-English metrical system."

<h3>III. SIX-STRESS AND SEVEN-STRESS VERSE</h3>


<h4>A.&mdash;THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER)</h4>

<p>The alexandrine was introduced into English from French verse, as early
(according to Schipper) as the early part of the thirteenth century.
Early poems in this metre alone, however, are almost wholly wanting, if
they ever existed. The early alexandrines usually appear in conjunction
with the septenary (seven-stress verse). The French alexandrine has
almost always been characterized by a regular and strongly marked medial
cesura, and this very commonly appears in the English form, but by no
means universally.</p>

<p>The French alexandrine is of uncertain origin. Kawczynski would trace it
to the classical Asclepiadean verse, as in</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"M&aelig;cenas atavis edite regibus,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which at least has the requisite number of syllables. It appeared in
France as early as the first part of the twelfth century, and in
four-line stanzas was the favorite for didactic poetry as late as the
beginning of the fifteenth century; otherwise, in the close of the
fourteenth century, it was supplanted by the decasyllabic. In the middle
of the sixteenth century it again won precedence over the
decasyllabic&mdash;in part through the influence of Ronsard&mdash;and is of course
the standard measure of modern French poetry. The name "alexandrine"
seems to have been applied in the fifteenth century, from the familiar
use of the measure in the Alexander romance. The earliest known mention
of the term is in Herenc's <i>Doctrinal de la secunde Retorique</i>. (See
Stengel's article in Gr&ouml;ber's <i>Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie</i>,
from which these statements are taken.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>The French alexandrine is in a sense a quite different measure from the
English form. Accent is an element of so comparatively slight importance
in the French language and French rhythm, that its place seems partly to
be filled by regularity of cesural pause and regularity in the counting
of syllables. The French alexandrine, therefore, may often be described
as a verse of twelve syllables, divided into two equal parts by a pause,
with marked accents on the sixth and twelfth syllables, but with the
other accents irregularly disposed. Often it seems to an English reader
to have an anapestic effect, and to be best described as anapestic
tetrameter. In English, however, while the regularity in the number of
syllables is followed, and very commonly the medial pause, there is also
observed the regularity of alternate accents which gives the verse the
characteristic form indicated by the term "six-stress."</p>

<p>This early poem illustrates the irregular use of alexandrines near the
time of their introduction into English. The poem opens with a
septenary&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Tho Iesu Crist an eorthe was, mylde weren his dede;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and septenaries and alexandrines are used interchangeably. Dr. Triggs
says, in his notes on the poem in McLean's edition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> of Zupitza's
<i>&Uuml;bungsbuch</i>, that lines 5, 6, 9-18, 25-28, 39, 40, 43, 44, 49-54, 57,
58, 63, 64, 66, 67, 70-72, 74, 75 are alexandrines. (Introduction, p.
lxii.) The English tendency toward indifference to regularity in the
counting of syllables is also noticeable. In the same way the early poem
called "The Passion of our Lord" (ed. Morris, E.E.T.S. xlix. 37), which
is thought from the heading&mdash;"<i>Ici cumence la passyun ihesu crist en
engleys</i>"&mdash;to be a translation from the French, shows a preponderance of
alexandrines, although it opens in septenary. See also such poems as the
"Death," "Doomsday," etc., in the <i>Old English Miscellany</i>. The
alexandrine was easily confused by the Middle English writers, not only
with the septenary, but with the native "long line," and it is often
difficult to say just what rhythm was in the writer's mind. Thus a line
like</p>

<span class="i2">"Be stille, leve soster, thin herte the to-breke,"<br /></span>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Browning</span>: <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, ix. 1872.)</p>

<p>Browning has made of the alexandrine in this poem an almost new measure,
hardly more like the alexandrine couplet of earlier days than the
measure of <i>Sordello</i> is like the "heroic couplet" proper. In general,
the modern use of the alexandrine is characterized by increased freedom
in the placing of the cesura. It is also distinguished from the early
French and Middle English forms by the fact that the cesura and the
ending are commonly masculine.</p>

<p>By far the most frequent use of the alexandrine in English poetry is as
a variant from the five-stress line. For instances of this, see the
section on the Spenserian stanza, pp. <a class="xref" href="#Page_102">102</a>-<a class="xref" href="#Page_108">108</a>, above, and Corson's
chapters on the Spenserian stanza and its influence, in his <i>Primer of
English Verse</i>. In connection with Dryden's use of the alexandrine as a
variant from the heroic couplet, Mr. Saintsbury makes some interesting
observations on the measure: "The metre, though a well-known English
critic has maltreated it of late, is a very fine one; and some of
Dryden's own lines are unmatched examples of that 'energy divine' which
has been attributed to him. In an essay on the alexandrine in English
poetry, which yet remains to be written, and which would be not the
least valuable of contributions to poetical criticism, this use of the
verse would have to be considered, as well as its regular recurrent
employment at the close of the Spenserian stanza, and its continuous
use.... An examination of the <i>Polyolbion</i> and of <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>,
side by side, would, I think, reveal capacities, somewhat unexpected
even in this form of arrangement. But so far as the occasional
alexandrine is concerned, it is not a hyperbole to say that a number,
out of all proportion, of the best lines in English poetry may be found
in the closing verses of the Spenserian stave as used by Spenser
himself, by Shelley, and by the present Laureate, and in the occasional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
alexandrines of Dryden. The only thing to be said against this latter
use is, that it demands a very skilful ear and hand to adjust the
cadence." (<i>Life of Dryden</i>, in Men of Letters Series, pp. 172, 173.)</p>


<h4>B.&mdash;THE SEPTENARY</h4>

<p>The septenary, or seven-stress verse (sometimes called the
<i>septenarius</i>, from the Latin form of the word) was a familiar measure
of medi&aelig;val Latin poetry. There it was more commonly trochaic than
iambic, as in the famous drinking song of the Goliards:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Meum est propositum in taberna mori:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vinum sit appositum morientis ori,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ut dicant cum venerint angelorum chori,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Deus sit propitius huic potatori!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="attrib">(See the "Confessio Goliae," in <i>Latin Poems attributed to Walter
Mapes</i>, ed. Wright, p. 71.)</p>

<p>Another form of the measure is illustrated by some verses quoted by
Schipper:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Fortunae rota volvitur, descendo minoratus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alter in altum tollitur, nimis exaltatus."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In English, naturally enough, the measure always tended to be iambic. In
both Latin and English there was considerable freedom as to the number
of light syllables. It will be noticed that in the specimens just quoted
from the Latin there is rime not only between the ends of the verses but
between the syllables just preceding the cesura. Where this was the case
there was a tendency toward the breaking up of the verse into a quatrain
of verses in four and three stresses, riming <i>abab</i>; such septenaries,
indeed, were written at pleasure either in couplets or quatrains. We
shall see the same phenomena in the English forms of the measure. But
the seven-stress rhythm is not easily lost or mistaken, in whatever form
it appears, and has a certain charm which at one time appealed very
widely to metrical taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest appearance of the septenary in English is in the <i>Poema
Morale</i>, dated about 1170 by Zupitza, by others somewhat later. For a
specimen of this, see p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_127">127</a>, above. Here there is only end-rime, and
the individuality of the long line is well preserved. There is some
freedom, however, as to the number of light syllables, and some
variation between the iambic and trochaic rhythm.</p>

<p>In this specimen we have the septenary without rime, a rare form. Orm's
septenaries are also the most regular of the Middle English period,
preserving an almost painful accuracy through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>out the 20,000 extant
lines of the poem. In general the measure appears in this period in
combination with alexandrines and other measures, and with much
irregularity. Like the alexandrine, it was sometimes confused with the
long four-stress line. In the well-known poem called "A Little Soth
Sermun" the first line is an unquestionable septenary ("Herkneth alle
gode men and stylle sitteth a-dun"), but presently we find verse of six
stresses, and even short four-stress couplets.</p>

<p>These specimens show the ballad stanza, which is made of a sort of
septenary resolved into short lines of four and three accents. It is
often assumed that the measure was derived from the Latin septenary; but
owing to the difficulty of supposing that a foreign metre should have
been adopted for the most popular of all forms of poetry, some scholars
prefer to think that the ballad stanza of this form is the same as that
in which all lines have four accents (see specimen on p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_157">157</a>, above),
the last accent of the second and fourth lines having dropped off by
natural processes. On the ballad stanzas in general, see Gummere's

<p>This is a rare instance of the use of the long septenary in

the introduction of hypermetrical light syllables. In the succeeding
specimen the same measure is used with feminine ending.</p>

<h4>C.&mdash;THE "POULTER'S MEASURE."</h4>

<p>In the Elizabethan age the alexandrine and the septenary were each used
chiefly in conjunction with the other, in alternation of six-stress and
seven-stress verses. The name commonly applied to the combination is
taken from Gascoigne's <i>Notes of Instruction</i> (1575), where he says:
"The commonest sort of verse which we use now adayes (viz. the long
verse of twelve and fourtene sillables) I know not certainly howe to
name it, unlesse I should say that it doth consist of Poulters measure,
which giveth xii. for one dozen and xiiii. for another." (Arber's
Reprint, p. 39.) It strikes the reader with surprise to find the measure
thus spoken of as "the commonest sort of verse," but a glance at any of
the early Elizabethan anthologies will show the justness of Gascoigne's
words. Yet the measure, while exceedingly popular, seems to have been
instinctively avoided by the best poets (after the days of Surrey and
Sidney); hence it is unfamiliar to modern readers.</p>

<p>The use of alexandrines and septenaries together, we have seen, was
common even in the Middle English period, but not in regular
alternation. The Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (about 1300) mingles
both measures, but with alexandrines predominating. In some of the early
Mystery Plays they are found in alternation; for example, where Jacob,
in one of the Towneley plays, is relating his hunger to Esau:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Meat or drink, save my life, or bread, I reck not what:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If there be nothing else, some man give me a cat."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>See also the specimen from <i>The Marriage of Wit and Science</i>, p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_256">256</a>,
above.</p>

<p>Schipper says that he does not know who first brought the two measures
together in alternate use for lyrical poetry. Guest says that the
Poulter's Measure came into fashion soon after 1500 (<i>History of English
Rhythms</i>), but gives no examples so early. The history of the measure
should be further investigated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Elizabethan period the Poulter's Measure practically
disappears from English poetry. A curious suggestion of it may be found
in a little poem of Leigh Hunt's (<i>Wealth and Womanhood</i>), cited by
Schipper, who calls the verse "Poulter's Measure in trochaics":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>IV. THE SONNET</h3>


<p>The sonnet is an Italian verse-form, in fourteen five-stress lines,
introduced into England at the time of the Italian literary influences
of the sixteenth century. Almost from the first, the English sonnet has
been divided into two classes: one based on more or less strict
imitation of the structure of the Italian form, and variously called the
Italian, the regular, or the legitimate sonnet; the other taking the
Italian sonnet as the point of departure, but constructed according to
more familiar English rime-schemes, and commonly called the Shaksperian
or the English sonnet.</p>

<p>The origin of the sonnet in southern Europe is a matter of some
disagreement. Some scholars trace it to the <i>canzone</i> strophe (<i>e.g.</i>
Gaspary, in his <i>Geschichte der Italienischen Literatur</i>), others to the
combination of the <i>ottava rima</i> with a six-line stanza (Welti, in his
<i>Geschichte des Sonettes in der deutschen Dichtung</i>), others to
Proven&ccedil;al and even German influence. (See Schipper, vol. ii. pp. 835
ff., and Lentzner's <i>Das Sonett und seine Gestaltung in der englischen
Dichtung</i>, p. 1.) It seems first to have been a recognized form in Italy
in the latter part of the thirteenth century (see Tomlinson's <i>The
Sonnet: its Origin, Structure, and Place in Poetry</i>); and was made
glorious by Dante, Michael Angelo, Tasso, Ariosto, and&mdash;above
all&mdash;Petrarch. On the different forms of the Italian sonnet, see
Tomlinson's essay, just cited.</p>

<p>"The object of the regular or legitimate Italian sonnet," says Mr.
Tomlinson, "is to express one, and only one, idea, mood, sentiment, or
proposition, and this must be introduced ... in the first quatrain, and
so far explained in the second, that this may end in a full point; while
the office of the first tercet is to prepare the leading idea of the
quatrains for the conclusion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> which conclusion is to be perfectly
carried out in the second tercet, so that it may contain the fundamental
idea of the poem." (pp. 27, 28.)</p>

<p>The Italian form is always marked by the division into octave and
sestet, although English usage has been very irregular in marking this
division by a full pause. The octave is based on only two rimes
(<i>abbaabba</i>); the sestet on either two or three, the most common
arrangements being <i>cdecde, cdcdcd, cdedce</i>, and <i>cddcee</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to the pause at the point of division Lentzner says: "It
should not be a full pause, because this would produce the effect of a
gap or breaking-off, ...&mdash;not like the speaker who has reached the end
of what he has to say, but like one who reflects on what has already
been said, and then takes fresh breath to complete his theme."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Most critics prefer those forms of sestet which avoid a final riming
couplet. This Mr. Courthope explains as follows: "The reason for the
avoidance of the couplet in the second portion of the sonnet is, I
think, plain. In the first eight lines the thought ascends to a climax;
this part of the sonnet may be said to contain the premises of the
poetical syllogism. In the last six lines the idea descends to a
conclusion, and as the two divisions are of unequal length it is
necessary that the lesser should be the more individualised. Hence
while, in the first part, the expression of the thought is massed and
condensed by reduplications of sound, and the general movement is
limited by quatrains; in the second part the clauses are separated by
the alternation of the rhymes, the movement is measured by tercets, and
the whole weight of the rhetorical emphasis is thrown into the last
line." (<i>History of English Poetry</i>, vol. ii. p. 91.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The sonnet has remained, since its introduction into English poetry, a
favorite form among poets and critics, but has never become genuinely
popular. It is suited, of course, only for the expression of dignified
and careful thinking; and the difficulty of giving it unity and
confining the content to the precise limit of fourteen lines has made
perfect success in the form a rare attainment. Furthermore, the
complexity of the rime-scheme&mdash;the distance at which one rime responds
to another&mdash;makes the appreciation of the form a matter of some
delicacy, less suited to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> the prevailingly simple taste of the English
ear than to the more complex taste of the Italian.</p>

<p>The following specimens are classified only in the two principal groups
of the Italian and the English form. The common test of the Italian form
is that the rime-scheme shall separate the first eight lines from the
rest, these eight lines ordinarily showing "inclusive rime" of the
<i>abba</i> type; the test of the English form is that the rime-scheme shall
separate the first twelve lines from the last two, the twelve lines
ordinarily showing alternate rime.</p>

<p>Schipper groups English sonnets in five classes: (1) the strict Italian
form, with pause between octave and sestet; (2) the Surrey-Shakspere or
English form; (3) the Spenserian form; (4) the Miltonic form, with
correct rime-arrangement but general neglect of the bipartite structure;
(5) the modern Italian or Wordsworthian form, following the regular
rime-scheme in general, but often with a third or even a fourth rime in
the octave, and treated as a single strophe. (<i>Englische Metrik</i>, vol.
ii. p. 878.)<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>


<h4>A.&mdash;THE REGULAR (ITALIAN) SONNET</h4>

<p>In this group the student of the subject should note the detailed
variations of the rime-scheme of the sestet, and the varying practice of
the poets as to the division between octave and sestet.</p>

<p>In view of the connection of Petrarch's sonnets with Wyatt's
introduction of the form into England, the first of them is reproduced
as a typical specimen of the strict Italian form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Wyatt who introduced the sonnet into England. Thirty-one of his
sonnets were published in Tottel's Miscellany, of which about a third
are said to be translations or paraphrases of Petrarch's. Wyatt
followed, of course, the regular Italian structure, but used
unhesitatingly the form of sestet with the concluding couplet
(<i>cddcee</i>). On this point Mr. Courthope says: "Wyatt was evidently
unaware of the secret principle underlying the extremely complex
structure of the Italian sonnet; ... and being unfortunately misled by
his admiration for the <i>Strambotti</i> of Serafino, which sum up the
conclusion in a couplet, he endeavored to construct his sonnets on the
same principle, thereby leading all sonnet writers before Milton on a
wrong path." (<i>History of English Poetry</i>, vol. ii. p. 91.)</p>

<p>Sidney's favorite form for the sonnet sestet was that shown in these
specimens (<i>cdcdee</i>), a form that suggests the influence of the Surrey
or English sonnet rather than the Italian. The first of the sonnets is
of course exceptional in being written in alexandrines, but is among the
finest in the sequence. See also Sidney's sonnet of the English type, p.
291, below.</p>

<p>The <i>Astrophel and Stella</i> (containing 110 sonnets) is the earliest of
the great sonnet-sequences or sonnet-cycles of English poetry, those of
Spenser, Shakspere, Rossetti, and Mrs. Browning being later
representatives. In the Elizabethan age the fashion of writing sonnets,
and sonnet-sequences in particular, was at its height, especially in the
last decade of the century (1590-1600). On this subject, see the
Introduction to Professor Schelling's <i>Elizabethan Lyrics</i>, in the
Athen&aelig;um Press Series, and Mr. Sidney Lee's <i>Life of Shakspere</i>. Other
noteworthy sonnet-sequences besides those of Sidney, Spenser, and
Shakspere were Constable's <i>Diana</i>, Daniel's <i>Delia</i>, Lodge's <i>Phyllis</i>,
Watson's <i>Tears of Fancy</i>, Barnes's <i>Parthenophil</i>, Giles Fletcher's
<i>Lycia</i>, and Drayton's <i>Idea</i>,&mdash;all published in the years 1592-1594. A
now forgotten poet by the name of Lok produced more than four hundred
sonnets, proving himself an Elizabethan rival to Wordsworth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Milton learned the sonnet direct from the Italian, and wrote five in
that language. While following the Italian rime-schemes, however, he was
not careful to observe any division between octave and sestet. Like
Donne, he turned the sonnet to other subjects than that of love, or&mdash;in

<p>Besides the eighteen English sonnets in regular form, Milton wrote a
"tailed," or "caudated," sonnet, following an Italian fashion,&mdash;"On the
New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament." "He intended it,"
says Masson, "to be what may be called an Anti-Presbyterian and
Pro-Toleration Sonnet; but by going beyond fourteen lines, converted it
into what the Italians called a 'sonnet with a tail.'" (Globe ed., p.
440.) The "tail" rimes <i>cfffgg</i>.</p>

Mr. Gosse, "is the author of the only sonnet written in English between

<p>Bowles (1762-1850) wrote numerous sonnets, and was influential in

<p>His sonnets were, however, neglectful of the regular Italian structure,
so that under his influence, as Leigh Hunt observed, "the illegitimate
order ... became such a favorite with lovers of easy writing who could
string fourteen lines together, that ... it continued to fill the press
with heaps of bad verses, till the genius of Wordsworth succeeded in
restoring the right system." (<i>Essay on the Sonnet</i>, p. 85.) But see the

<p>Wordsworth's complaint as to the number of Milton's sonnets ("alas, too
few!") certainly cannot be applied to his own. They number about five
hundred, ranking him as the most prolific English sonneteer. These
include some of the finest sonnets in the language, and very many of
admittedly indifferent quality. Mr. Swinburne regards his sonnets as on
the whole "the best out of sight" in our poetry. In general he followed
the Italian model, but with very great liberty. He not only practised
great variety of rime-arrangement in the sestet, but frequently altered
the scheme of the octave to such forms as <i>abbaacca</i>; see, for example,
the specimen beginning "Scorn not the Sonnet." Wordsworth also showed no
regard for the careful division of thought between octave and sestet.
Indeed in a letter to Dyce, in 1833, he said that he regarded the sonnet
not as a piece of architecture, but as "an orbicular body,&mdash;a sphere or
a dew-drop." (<i>Works</i>, ed. Knight, vol. xi. p. 232.) Its excellence
seemed to him to consist mainly in a "pervading sense of intense unity."
Nevertheless, he admitted that "a sonnet will often be found excellent,
where the beginning, the middle, and the end are distinctly marked, and
also where it is distinctly separated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> into <i>two</i> parts, to which, as I
before observed, the strict Italian model, as they write it, is
favorable."</p>

<p>The forty-four <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> (the title, of course,
being purely fanciful) constitute one of the chief sonnet-sequences of
the modern period. While true to the Italian rime-structure, Mrs.
Browning cannot be said to have treated the sonnet either as a two-part
poem or as a unit. Only three of the series, says Professor Corson (the
first, fourth, and thirteenth), "can be said to realize with any
distinctness the idea and the peculiar artistic effect of the sonnet
proper." Hence while calling them "the most beautiful love-poems in the
language," he thinks "they cannot be classed as sonnets." (<i>Primer of
English Verse</i>, pp. 175, 176.)</p>

<p>The sonnets of Rossetti are undoubtedly the most perfect representatives
of the Italian form in English poetry of the nineteenth century, and
<i>The House of Life</i> (in 101 sonnets) is probably to be regarded as the
most important sonnet-sequence since the Elizabethan age. The bipartite
character of Rossetti's sonnets is marked, in editions of his poems, by
the printing of the octave and sestet with a space between them.</p>

<p>It is curious that the two chief representatives of English poetry of
the Victorian period, Tennyson and Browning, should neither of them have
given much attention to the sonnet nor have achieved any notable success
in the form. Among Tennyson's poems there are some seventeen sonnets, of
which the present specimen was considered by the poet to be the best. It
represents a common form of the bipartite structure, where the octave is
a narrative, and the sestet a comment upon what has been narrated. In
the following specimen, from Matthew Arnold, the structure is similar.
Lentzner quotes the <i>East London</i>, in his monograph on the English
sonnet, as a case where the octave represents the thought in particular,
the sestet in the abstract; in other cases the order is the reverse.</p>

<p>Surrey experimented with the Italian sonnet as it had been introduced
into England by his master Wyatt, but soon devised a variation from the
Italian form, and wrote a majority of his sonnets in the new English
form (nine out of the sixteen which are printed in Tottel's Miscellany).
This new form is divided, not into octave and sestet, but into three
quatrains, with alternate rime, and a couplet. It produces, therefore,
an effect quite different from that of the legitimate Italian sonnet,
the couplet at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> the end giving it a more epigrammatic structure.
Surrey's form seems more consonant with common English taste for
simplicity of rime-structure, and, besides being honored by its adoption
by Shakspere, has remained a favorite side by side with the more
"correct" original.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

Commandments of the Sonnet" given by Mr. Sharp in his Introduction to
<i>Sonnets of this Century</i> (p. lxxviii):
</p><p>
"1. The sonnet must consist of fourteen decasyllabic lines.
</p><p>
"2. Its octave, or major system, whether or not this be marked by a
pause in the cadence after the eighth line, must (unless cast in the
Shakespearian mould) follow a prescribed arrangement in the
rhyme-sounds&mdash;namely, the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth lines must
rhyme on the same sound, and the second, third, sixth, and seventh on
another.
</p><p>
"3. Its sestet, or minor system, may be arranged with more freedom, but
a rhymed couplet at the close is only allowable when the form is the
English or Shakespearian.
</p><p>
"4. No terminal should also occur in any other portion of any other line
in the same system; and the rhyme-sounds (1) of the octave should be
harmoniously at variance, and (2) the rhyme-sounds of the sestet should
be entirely distinct in intonation from those of the octave....
</p><p>
"5. It must have no slovenliness of diction, no weak or indeterminate
terminations, no vagueness of conception, and no obscurity.
</p><p>
"6. It must be absolutely complete in itself&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, it must be the
evolution of one thought, or one emotion, or one poetically apprehended
fact.
</p><p>
"7. It should have the characteristic of apparent inevitableness, and in
expression be ample, yet reticent....
</p><p>
"8. The continuity of the thought, idea, or emotion must be unbroken
throughout.
</p><p>
"9. Continuous sonority must be maintained from the first phrase to the
last.
</p><p>
"10. The end must be more impressive than the commencement."
</p><p>
These rules of course represent the ideal of the strictest Italian form,
and are by no means derived from the prevailing practice of English
poets.</p></div>

<h3>V. THE ODE</h3>


<p>The term Ode is used of English poetry with considerable vagueness. The
Century Dictionary defines the word thus: "A lyric poem expressive of
exalted or enthusiastic emotion, especially one of complex or irregular
metrical form; originally and strictly, such a composition intended to
be sung." Compare with this the definition of Mr. Gosse, in his
collection of <i>English Odes</i>: "Any strain of enthusiastic and exalted
lyrical verse, directed to a fixed purpose, and dealing progressively
with one dignified theme."</p>

<p>Viewed from the purely metrical standpoint, English odes are commonly
either (<i>a</i>) regular Pindaric odes, imitative of the structure of the
Greek ode, or (<i>b</i>) irregular, so-called "Pindaric" or "Cowleyan" odes.
A third group may be made of forms based on the imitation of the choral
odes of the Greek drama. There is also a class of odes called
"Horatian," made up of simple lyrical stanzas; the name "ode" is applied
here only because of the content of the poem or because of resemblance
to the so-called odes (properly <i>carmina</i> or songs) of Horace, and since
these Horatian odes show no metrical peculiarities they will not be
represented here.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The characteristic effect of the ode is produced by the varying lengths
of lines employed, and the varying distances at which the rimes answer
one another. This variety, in the hands of a master of verse, is capable
of splendid effectiveness, but it gives dangerous license to the
unskilled writer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>: <i>A Pindaric Ode on the death of Sir H. Morison</i>. 1629.)</p>

<p>This ode of Jonson's is apparently the earliest, and remained for a long
time the only, notable English ode based on the strict structure of the
Greek original. The Greek ode was commonly divided into the strophe, the
antistrophe, and the epode; the strophe and antistrophe being identical
in structure, though varying in different odes, and the epode being of
different structure. Jonson therefore followed the classical form
carefully, and introduced English terms to express the original three
divisions.</p>

<p>Professor Bronson observes, in his Introduction to the Odes of Collins:
"It is a commonplace that the Pindaric Ode in English is an artificial
exotic, of slight native force, and unable to reproduce the effects of
the Greek original. The reason is obvious. The Greek odes were
accompanied by music and dancing, the singers moving to one side during
the strophe, retracing their steps during the antistrophe, ... and
standing still during the epode. The ear was thus helped by the eye, and
the divisions of the ode were distinct and significant. But in an
English Pindaric the elaborate correspondences and differences between
strophe, antistrophe, and epode are lost upon most readers, and even the
critical reader derives from them a pleasure intellectual rather than
sensuous." (Edition of Collins, Athen&aelig;um Press Series, Introduction, pp.

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Congreve</span>: <i>A Pindaric Ode on the victorious progress of her Majesty's
Arms</i>. 1706.)</p>

<p>To Congreve is due the credit for the revival of the regular ode in the
eighteenth century, after it had been long forgotten by English poets.
Meantime the irregular form, devised by Cowley, had become popular; and
against the license of this Congreve protested in his <i>Discourse on the
Pindaric Ode</i>, prefixed to his Ode of 1706. (See Mr. Gosse's
Introduction to <i>English Odes</i>, p. xvii., and his <i>Life of Congreve</i>, p.
158.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Congreve said in his Discourse: "The following ode is an attempt towards
restoring the regularity of the ancient lyric poetry, which seems to be
altogether forgotten, or unknown, by our English writers. There is
nothing more frequent among us than a sort of poems entitled Pindaric
Odes, pretending to be written in imitation of the manner and style of
Pindar, and yet I do not know that there is to this day extant, in our
language, one ode contrived after his model.... The character of these
late Pindarics is a bundle of rambling incoherent thoughts, expressed in
a like parcel of irregular stanzas, which also consist of such another
complication of disproportioned, uncertain, and perplexed verses and
rhymes.... On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the odes
of Pindar, both as to the exact observation of the measures and numbers
of his stanzas and verses, and the perpetual coherence of his
thoughts....</p>

<p>"Though there be no necessity that our triumphal odes should consist of
the three afore-mentioned stanzas, yet if the reader can observe that
the great variation of the numbers in the third stanza (call it epode,
or what you please) has a pleasing effect in the ode, and makes him
return to the first and second stanzas with more appetite than he could
do if always cloyed with the same quantities and measures, I cannot see
why some use may not be made of Pindar's example, to the great
improvement of the English ode. There is certainly a pleasure in
beholding anything that has art and difficulty in the contrivance,
especially if it appears so carefully executed that the difficulty does
not show itself till it is sought for....</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>
<p>"Having mentioned Mr. Cowley, it may very well be expected that
something should be said of him, at a time when the imitation of Pindar
is the theme of our discourse. But there is that great deference due to
the memory, great parts, and learning, of that gentleman, that I think
nothing should be objected to the latitude he has taken in his Pindaric
odes. The beauty of his verses is an atonement for the irregularity of
his stanzas.... Yet I must beg leave to add that I believe those
irregular odes of Mr. Cowley may have been the principal, though
innocent, occasion of so many deformed poems since, which, instead of
being true pictures of Pindar, have (to use the Italian painters' term)
been only caricatures of him."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>This ode consists of strophe, epode, antistrophe, and second epode. The
antistrophe corresponds metrically to the strophe, as usual; the epodes
are in four-stress couplets. It was Collins's habit to place the epode
between the strophe and antistrophe, perhaps, as Professor Bronson
suggests, in order that it may produce "an impression of its own
analogous to that of the Greek epode, namely, an impression of relief
and repose." Mr. Bronson says further of Collins's odes: "Collins was
less scholarly than Gray, but he was bolder and more original; and
consciously or unconsciously he so constructed his odes that their
organic parts stand out clearly distinct and produce effects analogous
to those produced by the Greek ode. In brief, his method was, first, to
make large divisions of the thought correspond to the large divisions of
the form; and, second, to throw out into relief the complex strophe and
antistrophe by contrasting them with a simple epode. The reader may not
perceive the minute correspondences in form between strophe and
antistrophe, but he can hardly fail to feel that the two answer to one
another in a general way." (Athen&aelig;um Press edition of Collins,
Introduction, p. lxxv.)</p>

all English odes of the regular Pindaric form. Mr. Lowell said, indeed,
that it "overflies all other English lyrics like an eagle." <i>The Bard</i>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Cowley</span>: <i>The Resurrection</i>, strophes iii. and iv. 1656).</p>

<p>Cowley, as has already appeared, introduced the irregular ode into
English poetry, calling it "Pindaric" under a misapprehension of the
real structure of the Greek odes. He published fifteen "Pindarique Odes"
in 1656 (see the Preface to these, in Grosart's edition of his works,
vol. ii. p. 4). The present specimen illustrates the really not
unskilful use which Cowley made of the varying cadences of the form, and
also sets forth&mdash;in the amusing concluding lines&mdash;his own idea of its
difficulties.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Cowley's odes, the new form speedily became
popular. According to Dr. Johnson, "this lax and law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>less versification
so much concealed the deficiencies of the barren, and flattered the
laziness of the idle, that it immediately over-spread our books of
poetry; all the boys and girls caught the pleasing fashion, and they who
could do nothing else could write like Pindar." (<i>Life of Cowley</i>.)
Compare also the remarks of Mr. Gosse: "Until the days of Collins and
Gray, the ode modelled upon Cowley was not only the universal medium for
congratulatory lyrics and pompous occasional pieces, but it was almost
the only variety permitted to the melancholy generations over whom the
heroic couplet reigned supreme." (<i>Seventeenth Century Studies</i>, p.
216.)</p>

<p>It has been the habit of modern critics to treat the irregularities of
the Cowleyan ode with no little contempt, and it is undoubtedly true
that in the hands of small poets its liberties are dangerous; but it is
also true that some of the greatest modern poets have adopted the form
for some of their best work, and that they have generally preferred it
to that of the regular Pindaric ode.</p>

<p>Dryden's odes for St. Cecilia's Day (especially the <i>Alexander's Feast</i>)
are among the most highly esteemed of his poems; but parts, at least, of
the ode on Mistress Killigrew are no less fine, and in this case we have
a purely literary ode, whose irregularities are not designed&mdash;as in the
case of the others&mdash;to fit choral rendering. The conclusion of the ode,
here quoted, seems to owe something of both substance and form to the
conclusion of Cowley's Resurrection Ode (see preceding specimen). Dr.
Johnson called Dryden's Killigrew Ode "undoubtedly the noblest ode that
our language ever has produced."</p>

<p>In this poem the English ode may be said to have reached its high-water
mark. Professor Corson observes: "The several metres are felt, in the
course of the reading of the Ode, to be organic&mdash;inseparable from what
each is employed to express.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> The rhymes, too, with their varying
degrees of emphasis, according to the nearness or remoteness, and the
length, of the rhyming verses, are equally a part of the expression....
The feelings of the reader of English poetry get to be set, so to speak,
to the pentameter measure, as in that measure the largest portion of
English poetry is written; and, accordingly, other measures derive some
effect from that fact. In the theme-metre, generally, the more
reflective portions of the Ode, its deeper tones, are expressed. The
gladder notes come in the shorter metres.... Wordsworth never wrote any
poem of which it can be more truly said than of his great Ode, 'Of the
soul the body form doth take.'" (<i>Primer of English Verse</i>, pp. 32-34.)</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Coventry Patmore</span>: Ode ix. Printed 1868.)</p>

<p>Mr. Patmore's use of the irregular ode forms is of particular interest.
He made a special study of the form, and applied it more widely than is
commonly done. His first odes were printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> (not published) in 1868, and
from one of these the present specimen is taken. Later (1877), in
connection with <i>The Unknown Eros</i>, he set forth his view of the ode
form, treating it not as lawless but as governed by laws of its own.
"Nearly all English metres," he said, "owe their existence as metres to
'catalexis,' or pause, for the time of one or more feet, and, as a rule,
the position and amount of catalexis, are fixed. But the verse in which
this volume is written is catalectic <i>par excellence</i>, employing the
pause (as it does the rhyme) with freedom only limited by the exigencies
of poetic passion. From the time of Drummond of Hawthornden to our own,
some of the noblest flights of English poetry have been taken on the
wings of this verse; but with ordinary readers it has been more or less
discredited by the far greater number of abortive efforts, on the part
sometimes of considerable poets, to adapt it to purposes with which it
has no expressional correspondence; or to vary it by rhythmical
movements which are destructive of its character. Some persons,
unlearned in the subject of this metre, have objected to this kind of
verse that it is 'lawless.' But it has its laws as truly as any other.
In its highest order, the lyric or 'ode,' it is a tetrameter, the line
having the time of eight iambics. When it descends to narrative, or the
expression of a less exalted strain of thought, it becomes a trimeter,
having the time of six iambics, or even a dimeter, with the time of
four; and it is allowable to vary the tetrameter 'ode' by the occasional
introduction of passages in either or both of these inferior measures,
but not, I think, by the use of any other. The license to rhyme at
indefinite intervals is counterbalanced ... by unusual frequency in the
recurrence of the same rhyme." (From Patmore's Prefatory Note to <i>The
Unknown Eros</i>; quoted by William Sharp, in the Introduction to <i>Great
Odes</i>, p. xxxii.)<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<h3>VI. IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL METRES</h3>


<p>While English verse is generally admitted to be based on a different
system from that of Greek and Latin poetry (the element of accent
obscuring that of quantity in English prosody, as the element of
quantity obscures that of accent in classical prosody), there have been
repeated attempts to introduce the more familiar classical measures into
English. Most of these attempts have been academic and have attracted
the attention only of critics and scholars; a few have interested the
reading public.</p>

<p>Imitations of classical verse in English may conveniently be divided
into two classes: imitations of lyrical measures, and imitations of the
dactylic hexameter. The latter group is of course much the larger,
especially in modern poetry. It will appear that the classical measures
might also be divided into two groups according to another distinction:
those attempting to observe the quantitative prosody of the original
language, and those in which the original measure is transmuted into
frankly accentual verse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The original impulse toward this classical or pseudo-classical verse was
a product of the Renaissance, when all forms of art not based on Greek
and Latin models were suspected. Rime, not being found in the poetry of
the classical languages, was treated as a product of the dark ages,&mdash;the
invention of "Goths and Huns." See Roger Ascham's <i>Schoolmaster</i> (1570)
for the most characteristic representative of this phase of thought in
England. The new forms of verse were, naturally enough, first tried in
Italy. Schipper traces the beginning of the movement to Alberti
(1404-1484). A century later Trissino wrote his <i>Sophonisbe</i> and <i>Italia
Liberata</i> in unrimed verse, in professed imitation of Homer, and was
looked upon as the inventor of <i>versi sciolti</i>, that is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> verses "freed"
from rime (compare the remarks of Milton in the prefatory note to
<i>Paradise Lost</i>). In 1539 Claudio Tolomei wrote <i>Versi e Regole della
Poesia Nuova</i>, a systematic attempt to introduce the classical
versification. He also wrote hexameters and sapphics. In France there
were similar efforts in the sixteenth century. Mousset translated Homer
into hexameters in 1530, and A. de Ba&iuml;f, a member of the "Pleiade"
(1532-1589), devised some French hexameters which he called <i>vers
ba&iuml;fins</i>. The English experiments were worked out independently, and yet
under the same neo-classical influences. On this subject, see Schipper,
vol. ii. pp. 2-12, 439-464.</p></div>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Sir Philip Sidney</span>: <i>Anacreontics</i>, from the <i>Arcadia</i>. ab. 1580.)</p>

<p>Sidney was a member of the little group of classical students who called
themselves the "Areopagus," and who were interested in introducing
classical measures into English verse. Others of the group were Gabriel
Harvey and Edmund Spenser, from whose correspondence most of our
information regarding the movement is derived. (See the letters in
Grosart's edition of Harvey's Works, vol. i. pp. 7-9, 20-24, 35-37,
75-76, 99-107.) Spenser's only known efforts in the same direction are
also preserved in this correspondence; a poem in twenty-one iambic
trimeters, and this "tetrasticon":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"See yee the blindfoulded pretie god, that feathered archer,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of lovers miseries which maketh his bloodie game?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wote ye why his moother with a veale hath coovered his face?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Trust me, least he my loove happely chaunce to beholde."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would seem that Spenser was attempting, more conscientiously than
Sidney did, to follow the classical rules of quantity in making his
verses; hence they are more difficult to read according to English
rhythm. Sidney's experiments in the classical versification are perhaps
the most successful, to modern taste, of all those made in the
Elizabethan period. Among the other songs in the <i>Arcadia</i> will be found
sapphics and hexameters.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>See especially Spenser's letter of April, 1580, and Harvey's reply (<i>op.
cit.</i>, vol. i. pp. 35, 99), for notable passages indicating the
seriousness with which the members of the "Areopagus" were trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
orm English verse so as to bring it under the rules of classical
prosody. The relations of quantity and accent were not understood, as
indeed they may be said still not to be understood for the English
language. Spenser suggests, in a frequently quoted passage, that in the
word <i>carpenter</i> the middle syllable is "short in speech, when it shall
be read long in verse,"&mdash;that is, because the vowel is followed by two
consonants; hence it "seemeth like a lame gosling that draweth one legge
after her.... But it is to be wonne with custome, and rough words must
be subdued with use." Harvey resented the idea that the common
pronunciation of words could be departed from in order to conform them
to arbitrary metrical rules, and in his reply said: "You shall never
have my subscription or consent ... to make your Carp&#275;nter our
Carp&#277;nter, an inche longer or bigger, than God and his Englishe
people have made him.... Else never heard I any that durst presume so
much over the Englishe ... as to alter the quantitie of any one
sillable, otherwise than oure common speache and generall receyved
custome woulde beare them oute." But while all English verse must be
consistent with "the vulgare and naturall mother prosodye," Harvey does
not despair of finding a system that shall be at the same time
"countervaileable to the best tongues" in making possible quantitative
verse. The whole passage is well worth reading. The best account of the
movement toward classical versification in the days of the "Areopagus"
will be found in Professor Schelling's <i>Poetic and Verse Criticism in
the Reign of Elizabeth</i> (Publications of the University of
Pennsylvania).</p></div>

<p>The full title of Campion's work was: "Observations in the Art of
English Poesie; wherein it is demonstratively proved, and by example
confirmed, that the English toong will receive eight severall kinds of
numbers, proper to it selfe, which are all in this booke set forth, and
were never before this time by any man attempted." Campion, like other
classical versifiers, condemned rime as a barbarity; but in imitating
the classical measures he does not violate the normal English accent, so
that his verses read smoothly in English rhythm. Curiously enough, he
includes among his innovations an iambic measure which proves to be
ordinary decasyllabic verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Goe numbers boldly passe, stay not for ayde<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of shifting rime, that easie flatterer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose witchcraft can the ruder eares beguile".<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Professor Schelling exclaims: "Where could the musical Doctor have kept
his ears all this time? to propose this measure thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> innocently for the
drama, when the English stage had been ringing with his 'licentiate
iambics' for more than two decades!"</p>

<p>The second of the specimens quoted above Campion describes as a dimeter
"whose first foote may either be a Sponde or Trochy: the two verses
following are both of them Trochaical, and consist of foure feete, the
first of either of them being a Spondee or Trochy, the other three only
Trochyes. The fourth and last verse is made of two Trochyes. The number
is voluble and fit to expresse any amorous conceit." (See also another
of Campion's measures, in Part One, p. <a class="xref" href="#Page_27">27</a>.)<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries few, if any, notable English
poems were written in the classical measures. Goldsmith, in one of his
essays (xviii, on Versification), maintained the possibility of reducing
English words to the classical prosody, and said: "We have seen several
late specimens of English hexameters and sapphics so happily composed
that, by attaching them to the idea of ancient measure, we found them in
all respects as melodious and agreeable to the ear as the works of
Virgil and Anacreon, or Horace." But whose these were it seems to be
impossible to say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>Tennyson took no little interest in the relations of classical and
English metres, and seems to have believed in the possibility of genuine
English quantitative verse. He did not, however, regard it as of
practical value, and treated his own experiments as trifles. In his
Memoirs, written by his son, Tennyson is said to have observed that he
knew the quantity of every English word except <i>scissors</i>, a mysterious
saying which may be set beside Southey's declaration that <i>Egypt</i> is the
only spondee in the English language. His son also preserves an
extemporaneous line composed by Tennyson to illustrate the observance of
quantity "regardless of accent":</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis's translations from Catullus are all "in the metres of the
original," and are among the most interesting specimens of modern
classical versifying. "Tennyson's Alcaics and Hendecasyllabics," he said
in his Preface, "suggested to me the new principle on which I was to go
to work. It was not sufficient to reproduce the ancient metres, unless
the ancient quantity was reproduced also." Of special interest is the
imitation of the "almost unapproachable" galliambic verse of the <i>Attis</i>

<p>Sidney was evidently trying to write genuinely quantitative hexameters.
Thus "of love," in the third line, may be regarded as a quantitative
spondee (the <i>o</i> being followed by two consonants), although the <i>of</i>
would not naturally be stressed. In like manner it is very possible that
"pallace" was spelled with two <i>l</i>'s in order to make the first syllable
seem long.</p>

<p>Sidney's hexameters are the first in literary verse which have come down
to us; but there must have been earlier efforts at least by the time of
Ascham's <i>Schoolmaster</i> (1570), which vigorously attacked "our rude
beggerly ryming, brought first into Italie by Gothes and Hunnes, ... and
at last receyved into England by men of excellent wit in deede, but of
small learning, and less judgement in that behalfe." (Arber Reprint, p.
145.) One hexameter distich by a contemporary and friend of Ascham's,
Master Watson of Cambridge, is handed down to us by Webbe, as being
"common in the mouthes of all men":</p>

<p>Stanyhurst's <i>Vergil</i> is one of the curiosities of Elizabethan
literature, not only from its verse-form but from its spelling and
diction. The translator declares himself a disciple of Ascham, in his
antipathy to rimed verse; "What Tom Towly is so simple," he asks, "that
wyl not attempt too bee a <i>rithmoure</i>?" In an address to the Learned
Reader he explains his system of English quantitative prosody. In 1593
Stanyhurst's hexameters were severely noticed in a passage by Thomas
Nash directed primarily against the classical versifying of Gabriel
Harvey. "The hexamiter verse," said Nash, "I graunt to be a gentleman of
an auncient house (so is many an English begger), yet this clyme of ours
he cannot thrive in; our speech is too craggy for him to set his plough
in; hee goes twitching and hopping in our language, like a man running
upon quagmiers, up the hill in one syllable and down the dale in
another, retaining no part of that stately smooth gate which he vaunts
himselfe with among the Greeks and Latins.... Master Stannyhurst (though
otherwise learned) trod a foule lumbring boystrous wallowing measure, in
his translation of Virgil." (Works of Nash, Grosart edition, vol. ii.

<p>When English hexameters were revived at the end of the eighteenth
century, it was in good part under German influence. Bodmer, Klopstock,
and Voss, followed later by Goethe, made the German hexameter popular;
and William Taylor of Norwich, who in many ways helped to familiarize
his countrymen with German literature, became interested in the form. In
1796, the year of Goethe's <i>Hermann und Dorothea</i>, he contributed to the
<i>Monthly Magazine</i> an article called "English Hexameters Exemplified,"
in which occurred the paraphrase from Ossian here quoted. Taylor pointed
out that the hexameter of the Germans was purely accentual. They were
"obliged, by the scarceness of long vowels and the rifeness of short
syllables in their language, to tolerate the frequent substitution of
trochees for spondees in their hexameter verse; and they scan, like
other modern nations, by emphasis, not by position." (Quoted in J. W.
Robberds's <i>Memoir of William Taylor of Norwich</i>, vol. i. pp. 157 ff.)
Most later writers of English hexameters have followed the line here
indicated, and have frankly abandoned the effort to represent the
quantities of classical prosody.</p>

strength," yet which should not profess to follow "rules which are
inapplicable to our tongue." (Preface to <i>Vision of Judgment</i>, Southey's

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Longfellow</span>: <i>Evangeline</i>, Part. I. 1847.)</p>

<p><i>Evangeline</i> is undoubtedly the most popular and widely read poem in
English hexameters, and may be said to have revived the vogue of the
measure in the middle of the nineteenth century. Yet its metrical
qualities have not pleased most careful critics. Matthew Arnold said
that the reception which the poem met with indicated that the dislike
for the metre "is rather among professional critics than among the
general public. Yet," he went on to say, "a version of Homer in
hexameters of the <i>Evangeline</i> type would not satisfy the judicious, nor
is the definite establishment of this type to be desired." (<i>On
Translating Homer</i>, Macmillan ed., p. 284.) Mr. Arnold had previously
suggested that the "lumbering effect" of such hexameters as Longfellow's
is "caused by their being much too dactylic"; more spondees should be
introduced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>The editor of the Riverside edition of <i>Evangeline</i> remarks
interestingly: "The measure lends itself easily to the lingering
melancholy which marks the greater part of the poem. The fall of the
verse at the end of the line and the sharp recovery at the beginning of
the next will be snares to the reader, who must beware of a jerking
style of delivery.... A little practice will enable one to acquire that
habit of reading the hexameter which we may liken, roughly, to the
climbing of a hill, resting a moment on the summit, and then descending
the other side."</p>

<p>Longfellow's hexameters were criticised most severely by his countryman,
Edgar Poe. Poe denied the possibility of any adequate representation of
the classical hexameter in English, largely because of the impossibility
of using English spondees. The only genuine hexameters he knew, he
declared, were some he had himself made, running:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Do tell! when may we hope to make men of sense out of the Pundits,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Born and brought up with their snouts deep down in the mud of the Frog-pond?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="attrib">(See Poe's Works, ed. Stedman and Woodberry, vol. vi. p. 104.)</p>

<p>Another interesting American experiment in hexameters is found in the
<i>Home Pastorals</i> of Bayard Taylor (1869-1874). Taylor modeled his verses
after those of the Germans, particularly Goethe's in <i>Hermann und
Dorothea</i>. See, for example, the opening lines of <i>November</i>:</p>

<p>Clough's hexameters are quite unlike any others in English poetry, both
in their metrical quality and in their use for serio-comic verse. As
Matthew Arnold observed, they are "excessively, needlessly rough," but
their free, garrulous effect has a charm of its own. Clough also wrote
some hexameters intended to be strictly quantitative. (For a detailed
criticism of the verse of the <i>Bothie</i>, see Robert Bridges's <i>Milton's
Prosody</i>, 1901 ed., Appendix J.)</p>

<p>It was Clough's hexameters, together with some "English Hexameter
Translations" by Dr. Hawtrey and Mr. Lockhart (1847), that chiefly
encouraged Matthew Arnold to believe that the measure might be well
adapted to a translation of Homer. "The hexameter, whether alone or with
the pentameter, possesses a movement, an expression, which no metre
hitherto in common use amongst us possesses, and which I am convinced
English poetry, as our mental wants multiply, will not always be content
to forego." (<i>Ib.</i>, p. 210.) Mr. James Spedding replied to Mr. Arnold's
suggestion, from the point of view of the classical scholar, urging that
only hexameters purely quantitative could properly represent those of
Vergil. He illustrated his views by an amusing "hexametrical dialogue,"
conducted alternately in Vergilian measure and "in that of Longfellow."
Of the former are the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Verses so modulate, so tuned, so varied in accent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rich with unexpected changes, smooth, stately, sonorous,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rolling ever forward, tidelike, with thunder, in endless<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Procession, complex melodies&mdash;pause, quantity, accent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">After Virgilian precedent and practice, in order<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Distributed&mdash;could these gratify th' Etonian ear-drum?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">James Spedding</span>: <i>Reviews and Discussions</i>, 1879. p. 327.)</p>

<p>Arnold, however, wisely declined to be led into a discussion of the
relations of accent and quantity in English. "All we are here concerned
with," he said, "is the imitation, by the English hexameter, of the
ancient hexameter <i>in its effect upon</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span><i> us moderns</i>.... The received
English type, in its general outlines, is, for England, the necessary
given type of this metre; it is by rendering the metrical beat of its
pattern, not by rendering the accentual beat of it, that the English
language has adapted the Greek hexameter.... I look with hope towards
continued attempts at perfecting and employing this rhythm; but my
belief in the immediate success of such attempts is far less confident
than has been supposed." (See the whole passage, <i>On Translating Homer</i>,
pp. 275-284.)</p>

<p>The hexameters of Dr. Hawtrey, quoted by Arnold, are these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Clearly the rest I behold of the dark-eyed sons of Achaia;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Known to me well are the faces of all; their names I remember;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Kastor fleet in the car,&mdash;Polydeukes brave with the cestus,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Own dear brethren of mine,&mdash;one parent loved us as infants.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are they not here in the host, from the shores of loved Lakedaimon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or, though they came with the rest in ships that bound through the waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dare they not enter the fight or stand in the council of heroes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All for fear of the shame and the taunts my crime has awakened?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">There, in their own dear land, their fatherland, Lakedaimon.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="attrib">(From <i>English Hexameter Translations</i>, p. 242.)</p>

<p>Arnold also illustrated his doctrine in some hexameters of his own,
which have not usually been regarded as a happy experiment. They run in
part as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="attrib">(<i>Ib.</i>, p. 234.)</p>

<p>Tennyson evidently viewed with small respect these various efforts to
render Homer in English hexameters. See his lines beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>In like manner Mr. Swinburne says: "I must say how inexplicable it seems
to me that Mr. Arnold, of all men, should be a patron of English
hexameters. His own I have tried in vain to reduce by scansion into any
metrical feet at all; they look like nothing on earth, and sound like
anapests broken up and driven wrong.... And at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> best what ugly bastards
of verse are these self-styled hexameters! how human tongues or hands
could utter or could write them except by way of burlesque improvisation
I could never imagine, and never shall." (<i>Essays and Studies</i>, p. 163.)
From this condemnation Mr. Swinburne excepts only the hexameters of Dr.
Hawtrey, "but that is simply a graceful interlude of pastime."</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">William Johnson Stone</span>: Translation of <i>Odyssey</i>, vi. 85 ff., in <i>The
Use of Classical Measures in English</i>. 1899.)</p>

<p>Mr. Stone, like the Elizabethan classical versifiers, seeks to write
purely quantitative verse in English, and, so far from aiming at the
same time to preserve the rhythm of the usual English hexameter, he
regards the clash between accent and quantity as a beauty rather than a
defect. The verses he intends to be read "with the natural accent
unimpaired," the reader listening for the regular quantities at the same
time.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The views of Mr. Stone on the nature of English accent and quantity are
perhaps unique among modern writers on the subject. "The ordinary
unemphatic English accent is exactly a raising of pitch, and nothing
more," as in Greek. "The accent of emphasis is something quite different
in character from the ordinary accent." To those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> insist that to
them the second syllable of <i>carpenter</i> is distinctly short, Mr. Stone
replies: "You are associating yourselves by such an admission with the
vulgar actors of Plautus rather than the educated readers of Virgil;"&mdash;a
truly terrible charge! Mr. Stone gives an interesting critical history
of earlier efforts to introduce classical measures into English. His
monograph is reprinted, but without the specimen translation, as the
second part of the 1901 edition of Robert Bridges's <i>Milton's Prosody</i>.</p>

Webbe's (1589), and was the most thorough treatment of the subject
written in the Elizabethan period, also discussed the "reformed
versifying," but with less respect. The chapter is entitled: "How if all
maner of sodaine innovations were not very scandalous, specially in the
lawes of any langage or arte, the use of the Greeke and Latine feete
might be brought into our vulgar Poesie, and with good grace inough."
(Arber Reprint of <i>The Arte of English Poesie</i>, p. 126.) Puttenham seems
to see the relations of quantity and accent somewhat more clearly than
most of his contemporaries, and while he gives rules for adapting
English words to quantitative prosody, he is disposed to think that
"peradventure with us Englishmen it be somewhat too late to admit a new
invention of feete and times that our forefathers never used nor never
observed till this day" (p. 132).</p></div>

<i>Defence of Ryme against a Pamphlet entituled Observations in the Art of
English Poesie</i>. "Wherein is demonstratively prooved that Ryme is the
fittest harmonie of words that comports with our Language." Daniel
struck at the root of all the principles of the classical
versifiers,&mdash;the supreme authority of the classics. "We are the children
of nature as well as they," he exclaims with reference to the ancients.
"It is not the observing of Trochaiques nor their Iambiques, that will
make our writings ought the wiser." And he expounds the English
accentual verse-system with clearness and vigor. This essay of Daniel's
may be said to mark the end, if it did not bring about the end, of the
Elizabethan experiments in classical metres. For other contemporary

<h3>VII. IMITATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL FRENCH LYRICAL FORMS</h3>


<p>A number of artificial lyrical forms, originating in the ingenuity of
the medi&aelig;val Proven&ccedil;al poets, were adopted by the Middle English
imitators of the Romance lyrists, and were revived with no little vigor
in the Victorian period. Chief among the influential models for these
forms, in early times, were the poems of Machault (1284-1377), Deschamps
(1328-1415), Froissart (1337-1410), and Villon (1431-1485). Again in the
seventeenth century such forms as the rondeau were revived in France by
Voiture (1598-1648), but with little effect in England. Finally, in the
nineteenth century, the forms were reintroduced by M. Th&eacute;odore de
Banville, and later into England by Mr. Lang, Mr. Austin Dobson, Mr.
Gosse, and others. For the history of these fashions in outline, see the
admirable introduction to Mr. Gleeson White's <i>Ballades and Rondeaus</i>
(1893); also Mr. Andrew Lang's <i>Lays and Lyrics of Old France</i> (1872);
Mr. Austin Dobson's "Note on some Foreign Forms of Verse," in the
collection of <i>Latter Day Lyrics</i> (1878); and an article by Mr. Edmund
Gosse in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, July, 1877.</p>

<p>Says Mr. Dobson: "It may be conceded that the majority of the forms now
in question are not at present suited for ... the treatment of grave or
elevated themes. What is modestly advanced for some of them ... is that
they may add a new charm of buoyancy,&mdash;a lyric freshness,&mdash;to amatory
and familiar verse, already too much condemned to faded measures and
out-worn cadences. Further, ... that they are admirable vehicles for the
expression of trifles or <i>jeux d'esprit</i>. They have also a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> humbler and
obscurer use. If, to quote the once-hackneyed, but now
too-much-forgotten maxim of Pope&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Those move easiest that have learned to dance,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>what better discipline, among others, could possibly be devised for
'those about to versify' than a course of Rondeaux, Triolets, and
Ballades?" Mr. Dobson refers to the article by Mr. Gosse already cited,
and "to the <i>Odes Funambulesques</i>, the <i>Petit Trait&eacute; de Po&eacute;sie
Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, and other works of M. Th&eacute;odore de Banville. To M. de
Banville in particular and to the second French Romantic School in
general, the happy modernization in France of the old measures of Marot,
Villon, and Charles of Orleans is mainly to be ascribed." (<i>Latter Day
Lyrics</i>, ed. W. D. Adams, pp. 334 ff.)<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Says Mr. Gleeson White: "The taste for these <i>tours de force</i> in the art
of verse-making is no doubt an acquired one; yet to quote the first
attempt to produce a lyric with a repeated burden would take one back to
the earliest civilization.... Whether the first refrains were used for
decorative effect only, or to give the singer time to recollect or
improvise the next verse, it matters little, since the once mere adjunct
was made in later French use an integral and vital part of the verse.
The charm of these strictly written verses is undoubtedly increased by
some knowledge of their technical rules.... To approach ideal
perfection, nothing less than implicit obedience to all the rules is the
first element of success; but the task is by no means finished there.
Every quality that poetry demands, whether clearness of thought,
elegance of expression, harmonious sound, or faultless rhythm, is needed
as much in these shapes as in unfettered verse.... It may be said,
without fear of exaggeration, that all the qualities required to form a
perfect lyric in poetry are equally needful here, <i>plus</i> a great many
special ones the forms themselves demand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> To the students of any art
there is always a peculiar charm when the highest difficulties are
surmounted with such ease that the consummate art is hidden to all who
know not the magic password to unveil it." (<i>Ballades and Rondeaus</i>,
Introduction, pp. xli, xlii.) "No one is compelled to use these complex
forms, but if chosen, their laws must be obeyed to the letter if success
is to be obtained. The chief pleasure they yield consists in the
apparent spontaneity, which is the result of genius, if genius be indeed
the art of taking infinite pains; or, if that definition is rejected,
they must yet exhibit the art which conceals art, whether by intense

<h4>A.&mdash;THE BALLADE</h4>

<p>The ballade commonly consists of three stanzas, with an envoy. In modern
usage the stanzas usually contain either eight or ten lines, and the
envoy half as many as the stanza; but in earlier usage both stanza and
envoy varied, and the latter might be omitted altogether. The rimes in
all the stanzas must be identical in the corresponding lines, but the
riming words must be different. The most characteristic element is the
refrain,&mdash;the keynote of the poem,&mdash;which forms the last line of each
stanza, including the envoy. The favorite rime-scheme for the eight-line
stanza is <i>ababbcbc</i>, with the envoy <i>bcbc</i>. Mr. White says of the envoy
that it "is not only a dedication, but should be the peroration of the
subject, and richer in its wording and more stately in its imagery than
the preceding verses, to convey the climax of the whole matter, and
avoid the suspicion that it is a mere postscript."</p>

the old form, and imitates the ancient custom of addressing the envoy to
royalty. This <i>motif</i>, of old things lost, is a favorite one for the
serious ballade, being suggested by Villon's <i>Ballade of Dead Ladies</i>.

<p>This specimen represents the ballade in ten-line stanzas.</p>

<p>There is also an extended form of the ballade, called the <i>Chant Royal</i>,
with five stanzas and envoy, the stanzas consisting of eleven verses.
The usual rime-scheme is <i>ababccddede</i>, with envoy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> <i>ddede</i>. For
admirable specimens, see Mr. Dobson's <i>Dance of Death</i> and Mr. Gosse's
<i>Praise of Dionysus</i>, in <i>Ballades and Rondeaus</i>, pp. 98, 100. Mr. White
says of this form: "The chant royal in the old form is usually devoted
to the unfolding of an allegory in its five stanzas, the envoy supplying
the key; but this is not always observed in modern examples. Whatever be
the subject, however, it must always march in stately rhythm with
splendid imagery, using all the poetic adornments of sonorous,
highly-wrought lines and rich embroidery of words, to clothe a theme in
itself a lofty one. Unless the whole poem is constructed with intense
care, the monotony of its sixty-one lines rhymed on five sounds is
unbearable." (<i>Ballades and Rondeaus</i>, Introduction, p. liv.)</p>


<h4>B.&mdash;THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL</h4>

<p><i>Rondel</i> is the old French form of the word <i>rondeau</i>, and the terms are
therefore naturally interchangeable. They have been applied to a number
of different forms, all characterized by a refrain so repeated as to
link together different parts of the structure. Two of these forms are
particularly familiar. The first (called more commonly the <i>rondel</i>)
consists of fourteen lines, with only two rimes; the first two lines
constitute the refrain, and are commonly repeated as the seventh and
eighth and again as the thirteenth and fourteenth. The rime-scheme
varies, but is often <i>ABba, abAB, abbaAB</i> (the capitals indicating the
repeated lines of the refrain). Sometimes the form is shortened to
thirteen lines, the second line of the refrain not being repeated at the
close. The second principal form (called more commonly the <i>rondeau</i>)
consists of thirteen lines, with two rimes, and an unrimed refrain,
taken from the opening words of the first line, which follows the eighth
line and is again repeated at the end. The common rime-scheme is
<i>aabba,aab (refrain), aabba
(refrain)</i>. Both these forms are found in early French poetry, together
with many variations. The modern distinction between <i>rondeau</i> and
<i>rondel</i> is artificial but convenient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

xviii. p. 478. ab. 1540.)</p>

<p>Besides the rondeaus found in the Wyatt MS., three poems of Wyatt's,
published in Tottel's <i>Songs and Sonnets</i> (1557), were evidently
intended as rondeaus (see Arber's Reprint, pp. 53, 73). The editor, not
understanding the form or thinking it too unfamiliar to be popular,
seems to have changed it to a sort of sonnet, omitting the refrain at
the end and making a complete line of it as the ninth of the poem. These
hidden rondeaus were discussed by Mr. Dobson in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for 1878
(vol. i. p. 380); see also Alscher's <i>Sir Thomas Wyatt und seine
Stellung</i>, etc.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Swinburne</span>: <i>The Roundel</i>, in <i>A Century of Roundels</i>.)</p>

<p>Mr. Swinburne has reintroduced the old word-form "roundel," to
distinguish this style of rondeau, of his own devising, with nine long
lines, riming <i>aba, bab, aba</i>, the refrain riming also with the <i>b</i>
lines.</p>


<h4>C.&mdash;THE VILLANELLE</h4>

<p>This highly intricate form was originally used for pastoral or idyllic
verse, and it is commonly reserved, as Mr. Dobson observes, for subjects
"full of sweetness and simplicity." In its typical form it consists of
nineteen lines, divided into five groups or stanzas of three and one of
four. There are but two rimes, and the two verses which constitute the
refrain recur again and again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span> line 1 reappearing as line 6, line 12,
and line 18, while line 3 reappears as line 9, line 15, and line 19. The
rime scheme of all the tercets is <i>aba</i>, of the conclusion <i>abaa</i>. Those
villanelles are considered most highly finished in which the refrain
recurs with slightly different significations.</p>

<p>On the history of this form, see J. Boulmier's <i>Les Villanelles</i>, Paris,
1878. The modern development of the villanelle has been largely
influenced by the work of Passerat (1534-1602), whose most famous
villanelle is the following specimen:</p>

<h4>D.&mdash;THE TRIOLET</h4>

<p>The triolet is really a diminutive form of the Rondeau, and was not
originally distinguished by name. It consists of eight lines, with two
rimes, lines 1 and 2 recurring as lines 7 and 8, and line 1 also as line
4. The rime-scheme is <i>ABaAabAB</i>. Here, as in the villanelle, a change
of signification in the repeated lines is thought to add to the charm of
the form.</p>

<p>A French specimen, from Ranchin, is cited by Mr. Gleeson White as being
called by some "the king of triolets":</p>

<h4>E.&mdash;THE SESTINA</h4>

<p>This form, although originally found in Proven&ccedil;al like the others of the
group, has been more used in Italy than in France, and, as the English
form of the word indicates, was introduced into England under Italian
influence. It was invented at the end of the thirteenth century, by the
troubadour Arnaut Daniel, celebrated in the following specimen. The
common form of the sestina has six stanzas of six lines each, with a
tercet at the end. There is usually no rime, but the stanzas are based
on six end-words, which are the same in all stanzas; in the tercet three
of these words are used in the middle of the lines, and three at the
ends. The order of the end-words changes in each stanza accord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>ing to a
complex system: thus (in the common modern form) if the end-words of the
first stanza be represented by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the order in the second
stanza will be 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3; in the third, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5; in the
fourth, 5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4; in the fifth, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2; in the sixth,
2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 1. Sometimes the end-words also rime by twos and threes.</p>

<p>The Virelai, which we have seen was one of the forms used by Chaucer,
though not represented in his extant poetry, has been but slightly
imitated in English. It was a poem of indeterminate length, composed of
longer and shorter lines, the longer lines in each stanza riming, the
shorter lines in the same stanza also riming, while in the succeeding
stanza the short-line rime of the previous stanza became the long-line
rime. The last stanza took the unrepeated rime of the first stanza as
its new rime; so that in the whole poem each rime was used in two
stanzas. Charles Cotton, one of whose rondeaus has been quoted, also
wrote a virelai. A modern specimen, by Mr. John Payne, is quoted in
<i>Ballades and Rondeaus</i>, p. 276.</p>

<p>The Pantoum is another very interesting form belonging in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> this group
rather than elsewhere, although it originated not in France but
Malaysia. It was imitated in French by Victor Hugo and other poets, and
through French influence has found a place in English verse. It consists
of an indeterminate number of stanzas of four lines each, the second and
fourth line of each stanza being repeated as the first and third of the
succeeding stanza, while the second and fourth lines of the last stanza
repeat the first and third lines of the first stanza. Thus the whole
forms a sort of interwoven circle, and is used most appropriately to
represent any kind of monotony,&mdash;the dull round of repetition. From
<i>Love in Idleness</i> (1883) Mr. White reprints the following admirable

<h3>THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></h3>


<p>Nearly all modern writers on the theory of verse have admitted that
English words have no fixed syllabic quantities such as are postulated
for the classical languages, but that English quantities, so far as they
exist, are variable and (in part at least) subjective in character. To
this it is true there are exceptions, chiefly among the poets, like some
of those considered in the preceding section on Imitations of Classical
Metres.</p>

<p>Writers who have agreed that English words have no fixed quantities, are
still at variance as to the relation of the element of syllabic time to
the element of accent in English verse. Two extremes may at once be
distinguished: that represented by the familiar statement that our
rhythms differ from those of classical poetry in being based wholly on
accent, and that represented most notably by the late Sidney Lanier, who
held that syllabic time-values in English verse are as exact and regular
(hence as accurately measurable) as the notes of music. Lanier applied
his theory with admirable consistency, and represented all sorts of
English verse, even that of the Anglo-Saxon period, in musical notation.
He is almost universally regarded, however, as having been led by the
analogy between music and poetry to carry his method to quite impossible
lengths. The most characteristic example of this is his representation
of the familiar "blank verse" measure in "three-four" time, each
accented syllable being given a time-value twice as long as that of the
adjacent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> unaccented syllable&mdash;a method of reading which can easily be
shown to be contrary to all common practice. It should not be forgotten,
however, that a debt of gratitude is owed Mr. Lanier for having been one
of the first to emphasize adequately the fact that verse, like music, is
<i>rhythmical sound</i>.</p>

<p>Besides those who make English verse to depend wholly on accent, and
those who give it time-values equally regular and measurable with those
of music, there is a third class disposed to confuse the two elements of
quantity and accent. Of this class was Edgar Poe, who in his essay on
The Rationale of Verse constantly spoke of accented and unaccented
syllables as "long" and "short," respectively, and was even disposed to
carry the identification into Latin verse itself. This essay of Poe's
has lately been defended by Mr. John M. Robertson, in the interesting
Appendix to his <i>New Essays toward a Critical Method</i> (1897).
Unfortunately Mr. Robertson seems to have perpetuated deliberately the
confusion which he found in Poe in the use of the terms "accent" and
"quantity." He even says that the attempt to distinguish them is
ill-founded, "that quantity in speaking <i>must</i> amount substantially to
the same thing as stress," and, again, that "Poe's identification of
stress with length is perfectly sound." Whatever be the fundamental fact
here, the use of terms cannot be commended. If quantity is swallowed up
in accent, so that accent alone dominates our verse, that is one thing;
if the conditions are such that a heavy stress and a long quantity
nearly always coincide, that is also a possible doctrine; but that is
not to say that the two things should be identified. If all tall men
wear long coats, or if all men&mdash;tall and short&mdash;wear long coats, it
follows in neither case that tallness and long-coatedness are the same
thing. It is a mere matter of physics that duration of sound and
intensity of sound are perfectly distinguishable, and that they have no
necessary connection with each other. The problem is: how are they
related in practice?</p>

<p>It has already been observed that Mr. Lanier did good service in
emphasizing the analogy between music and poetry, but that he carried
the analogy too far. It may, therefore, be worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span> while to consider at
just this point the elements of likeness and of difference in the two
forms of art. Both are forms of <i>rhythmical</i> art: music and verse are
alike rhythmical sound. Lanier showed with sufficient certainty that
rhythm is dependent upon both <i>time</i> and <i>accent</i>. He said, to be sure,
that "time is <i>the</i> essential" element;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> but this does not seem to
have been altogether what he meant, for he himself pointed out that the
ear insistently marks off time-elements by the sense of variation of
stress, even when there is no real variation, as in the tick-tack of the
clock. He also pointed out that accent marks the rhythm of music quite
as truly as that of verse, the rule being that ordinarily the first note
of each measure shall receive a special stress. It seems, then, that the
rhythm of music is based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal
time-intervals. The same thing is true of the rhythm of verse. For every
kind of metre there is a normal verse-rhythm which is present in the
mind as the basis on which the verse is built up, no matter how many
variations may constantly occur. This normal rhythm is formed by a
succession of accents at exactly equal time-intervals,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> such as can
be marked off by a metronome, or by the mechanical beating of the foot
on the floor. We realize that the verse as commonly read frequently
departs from this regularity of intervals; but without the regularity as
a norm to which to refer it, we should not recognize it as verse. The
normal accent-interval we call a "foot."</p>

<p>Exception must therefore be taken, it seems to me, to another contention
of Mr. Robertson's; namely, that "there is no time-unit." "Our feet," he
says, "are a pure convention, and the sole rhythmic fact is the
fluctuant relativity of long and short, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span> stress and slur." I am glad
to be able to believe that the fundamental rhythmic fact is something
more definite than this.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But the latest writer on the subject, Mr.
Mark Liddell, in his <i>Introduction to the Scientific Study of Poetry</i>,
joins Mr. Robertson in finding no feet in English verse. Nay, he
represents the metrist who makes use of the old conventions of
rhythmical measurement as one who will "flounder ceaselessly amid the
scattered timbers of iambuses, spondees, dactyls, tribrachs, never
reaching the firm ground of truth"! Mr. Liddell points out that we do
not pronounce English words, even in verse, with mechanically regular
alternations of stress; and he rejects the explanation that there is
nevertheless a typical form in the poet's and the reader's mind, on the
ground that it is "a strange state of affairs that the &aelig;sthetically
imperfect should produce a greater pleasure than the &aelig;sthetically
perfect." Strange, perhaps, but as familiar as sunrise, if by
"&aelig;sthetically perfect" we mean absolutely regular. Here we need to recur
to the analogy of music, where the phenomenon in question is so obvious.
Let any one attempt to follow a symphony with a metronome in his hand,
and he will soon discover that if the metronome represents the
&aelig;sthetically perfect rhythm, the orchestra represents a more pleasurable
imperfection. Its accelerations and retardations carry on a continual
conflict with the typical time of the music, yet that typical time is
not only printed on every sheet, but is in the mind of every player. It
is precisely so with verse.</p>

<p>It is true, of course, that the variations from regularity of rhythm are
more numerous and conspicuous in verse than in music. The reason is
obvious: the sounds of verse have constantly to effect a compromise
between the typical rhythm to which they are set and the irregular
stress-and time-variations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> of human speech, while music has no such
complicated task. Lyrical verse, being closest to music, keeps the
typical rhythm freest from interruption; and it is worthy of remark that
Mr. Liddell's study of English rhythms is based very largely on those of
a non-lyrical character, although he himself points out (p. 271) that
these are the least regular. The drama is dominated, most of all forms
of verse, by the necessity of representing natural human speech; hence
it is not the place to look for the fundamental laws of verse at their
purest.</p>

<p>There is, then, a unit of time on which all verse-rhythms, like all
musical rhythms, are based; and this is what we commonly call in music
the <i>measure</i>, and in verse, the <i>foot</i>, I shall recur to this matter a
little later in considering the terminology of the subject; for the
present let us return to the relations of verse and music. Both, we have
seen, are based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal
time-intervals. There is some difference, however, in the emphasis which
one naturally places on the respective parts of the statement. In music
we feel that the fact of chief importance is that the measures shall be
equal in time, while the recurring accent seems a mere means of marking
this equality; but in verse we feel that the chief fact is that the
accents shall recur, the equality of time-intervals being in a sense a
secondary source of pleasure. In music, therefore, as we have seen, we
treat departures from regularity of time-intervals as somewhat more
exceptional than in verse. But the rhythm would suffer, would even
disappear, were either element wholly removed.</p>

<p>If we look for further distinctions between verse and music, we find
them in the separate sounds which go to make up the unit-measures. Not
only are the measures of music of mathematically equal length, but all
the sounds bear exact time-relations to each other: each is either half
as long, or twice as long, or a quarter as long, or four times as long,
as its neighbor. On the other hand, the number of separate sounds in the
measure constantly varies; it is sufficient that the total length be
that of the full measure. In verse these conditions are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> reversed. The
separate syllables, while they doubtless vary in length, are not
mathematically co&ouml;rdinated as to duration by the ordinary reader. It is
almost as difficult to say just what the time-relation of any two
adjacent syllables is, as to be sure that one is stressed just twice as
strongly as the other. On the other hand, the <i>number</i> of syllables in
the foot (in good modern English verse) is tolerably constant.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, one may add two other fundamental
distinctions which, <i>apart</i> from the elements of rhythm, differentiate
verse from music. Music, apart from rhythm, characteristically depends
on variation of pitch, and only incidentally (as in the case of the use
of different instruments in orchestration) on variation of
sound-quality; whereas verse, apart from rhythm, characteristically
depends on variation of sound-quality,&mdash;that is, on the different sounds
of the different words,&mdash;and only incidentally on changes of pitch.
Finally, the changing sounds of music are only vaguely symbolic, while
the changing sounds of verse are symbolic of definite ideas.</p>

<p>For the sake of easy comparison we may put these observations in a rough
sort of table:</p>

<p>Let us now consider more closely the time-values of the separate
syllables of verse, asking just what we mean by a "long"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span> or a "short"
syllable in English. It has already been indicated that the ear
recognizes no such fixed proportions in the length of our syllables as
are recognized for musical notes, or as are postulated for the syllables
of Greek and Latin verse. It must also be remembered that the terms
"long" and "short," as commonly used of English vowels, are of little
significance for the matter of real quantity. They are applied for
historical reasons, and do not describe present facts. Thus we call the
<i>o</i> in "hotel" <i>long</i>, and that in "cot" short; but it is fairly clear
that the <i>o</i> of "cot" takes rather more time, as commonly uttered, than
that of "hotel." The so-called "short <i>o</i>" is, in fact, a sound so open
that it has lost the <i>o</i>-quality. In the same way what we call "long
<i>a</i>" is a short-<i>e</i> sound diphthongized. We cannot be said to preserve
in modern English any single vowels with fixed long quantity, such as we
hear in German words like <i>Saal</i> and <i>See</i>,&mdash;sounds which obviously take
more time in utterance than others.</p>

<p>Can we speak accurately, then, of long syllables and short syllables in
modern English? It may be said that we have a large number of genuine
diphthongs; and such double sounds, especially where they are so open as
to require unusual effort on the part of the vocal organs (like <i>-ow</i>,
for example), may be assumed to take a longer time in utterance than
monophthongs. Even such a sound as is represented by <i>-au</i> or <i>-aw</i>,
though it has but slight diphthongal quality, seems to sound longer than
most monophthongs. But in none of these cases does ordinary
pronunciation make the sound-length at all conspicuous, except where it
coincides with strong stress; and it requires a moment's reasoning to
convince one's self that the vowel in <i>fine</i> is any longer than that in
<i>fan</i>. It is more than doubtful, then, whether our vowel sounds can be
regarded as of significance for metrical time. A word like "saw" or
"now," occurring in such a place in the verse as to be passed over with
the briefest and lightest utterance, would be pronounced with rapidity
by the ordinary reader, with no thought that the vowel-sound was too
"long."</p>

<p>But in the earlier languages a syllable might be long, not only from the
presence of a long vowel, but also from the presence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> two or more
consonants following the vowel. May this be said to hold good for modern
English? In general, prolonged consonantal sounds seem to be avoided, as
in the case of vowels. We pass over them rapidly, and have, for
instance, no such clearly stopped syllables due to double consonants as
are heard in Italian words like <i>madonna</i>. Yet we cannot doubt that two
or three consonants require more time than one, and in words like
<i>strength</i>, <i>flushed</i>, <i>fists</i>, and the like, every one would find the
consonantal length perceptible. More than this, two consonants often
serve to "close" the preceding syllable, by making it impossible to run
the consonant at the end of it over into the following syllable, and
hence really lengthen it. This, of course, is the reason why the first
syllable of the Latin <i>avis</i> is said to be short, but that of <i>alvus</i> to
be long. The Elizabethan metrists tried to apply these Latin rules of
"quantity by position" to all English words; and many modern English
writers, who have been trained from childhood in the appreciation of
Latin quantities, easily perceive the differing consonantal quantities
of English words. These quantities may, then, certainly be said to
exist; but in ordinary English pronunciation, and to the ordinary,
untrained English ear, they must be strongly marked in order to attract
attention. When thus strongly marked, they doubtless play some part in
the structure of verse. In some lines attributed to Raleigh,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"His desire is a dureless content,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And a trustless joy,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the syllable <i>trust</i>-occupies the time of two syllables; the typical
metre would require something like</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And a pitiless joy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, the fact that <i>trust</i>-is a noticeably long syllable, especially
when closed by the following <i>l</i>, makes it well fitted to fill the place
of two syllables; and we should find the line distinctly less pleasing
if a short syllable were there instead. <i>Boundless</i> would do as well,
because equally long; <i>trusty</i> would not be quite so good; <i>silly</i> would
be very bad. Conversely, when a noticeably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> long syllable occupies the
place of a light syllable, in rapid tri-syllabic verse, we feel that
the verse is injured. Mr. William Larminie criticises a line of Mr.
Swinburne's on this ground,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Time sheds them like snow on strange regions;"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the combination <i>-ange</i>, with its final <i>-nj</i> sound, made still longer
by the following <i>r</i>, and preceded, too, by the combination <i>n-st</i>, has
too much quantity for the place where it stands in the verse. In the
verse of inferior writers many worse cases could easily be found. These
illustrations, then, may serve to show that while we do not co&ouml;rdinate
our consonantal syllable-lengths as absolute "shorts" and "longs," we
perceive certain degrees of length, and find these playing a part in our
verse.</p>

<p>So much for intrinsic quantity as found in English syllables. But there
is much more to be said for syllables made long or short at the will of
the speaker, under certain conditions. If we address a friend in
surprise, saying, "<i>Why, John!</i>" we not only throw a heavy stress on
both the words, but also perceptibly prolong them. In like manner, we
realize that unimportant words, especially proclitics (like the
italicized words in the phrase "<i>The</i> land <i>of the</i> free") are not only
unstressed, but are hurried over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> in shorter moments than the accented
words. Examples like this suggest what may in fact be expressed in a
general statement, that accented syllables are very commonly prolonged.
This is not, as we have seen, from any essential connection between the
nature of accent and the nature of quantity. In certain cases,
unaccented syllables even show a tendency to length beyond that of those
bearing the stress, as in words like <i>follow</i>, <i>dying</i>, and others where
the final sound is easily prolonged. The coincidence of stress and
length, then, is due simply to the operation of the same cause&mdash;the
grammatical or rhetorical importance of the syllable in question. This
fact, that the important (stressed) syllables are likely to be held a
little longer than the others, will not warrant us in representing them
as <i>twice</i> as long, in the exact mathematical relations of musical
notes; but it may explain why a musician like Lanier tried to represent
them in such notation. It must also be the cause of Mr. Robertson's
attempt to identify quantity and stress. His statement that "quantity in
fact, in spoken verse, consists of stress <i>and</i> of the consonantal total
of syllables," may be regarded as much more satisfactory than those
already quoted from his essay. It is, however, not quite accurate.</p>

<p>Still another kind of relative syllable-length remains to be considered,
and for metrical purposes it is probably the most important. The
<i>accents</i> of English words not only vary in degree according to the
different stresses which they receive in different prose sentences, but
in verse they are made artificially to vary also so as to conform as
closely as possible to the scheme of the metre. Thus the first syllable
of the word <i>over</i> is accented far more strongly when it occurs at the
opening of a dactylic verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Over the ocean wave,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>than when it occurs at the opening of an anapestic verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Over land, over sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This being the case with accent, which tends to be strongly fixed in
English words, we might naturally expect that it would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> still more
clearly the case with the element of time; and so it is. Syllables will
be lengthened and shortened by the reader in order to preserve as nearly
as possible the fundamental equal time-intervals between the principal
accents. This is most easily recognized, and most commonly practised, in
the case where syllables are shortened because there are more of them
than the normal scheme of the verse would imply. The old "tumbling
verse" of our ancestors depended on this principle, and so did the
revival of it in Coleridge's <i>Christabel</i>. For example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"A little door she opened straight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All in the middle of the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gate that was ironed within and without,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where an army in battle array had marched out."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here the rhythm of the last verse is brought into the four-beat measure
of the first verse, by passing lightly and rapidly over all syllables
save the four that mark the metre. In prose, the word <i>marched</i> would be
stressed quite as much as the word <i>out</i>, but there is no difficulty in
reducing the stress in reading the verse.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> <a name="corr_2" id="corr_2"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: In">It</ins> cannot be said,
however, that there is no difficulty in reducing its <i>length</i>, for the
final consonant combination <i>-cht</i> takes up considerable time, and the
whole word follows a syllable (<i>had</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> which has been closed and so
lengthened by the <i>d + m</i>. Sensitive readers would probably agree,
therefore, that the quantity in this verse is too much for the
smoothness of the rhythm. On the other hand, the long syllable <i>ironed</i>
helps us to fill the place of the light syllable which is missing after
it, and we find the rhythm easier than it would be in this form:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The gate that was ironed both within and without."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Once more, for the sake of convenience, let us attempt to put our
conclusions into the form of a summary. An English syllable may be said
to be <i>long</i>, not absolutely but <i>relatively</i>, from:</p>

<p>
<span class="left3em">[1. The naturally long character of its vowel-sound, due either</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">to open quality or diphthongization.]</span><br />
<br />
<span class="left3em">2. The presence of two or more consonants which require a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">perceptible time for utterance.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="left3em">3. Prolongation by the speaker</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">(<i>a</i>) because of the importance of the syllable, or</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">(<i>b</i>) because of the time which it ought to occupy in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">the scheme of the verse.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The artificial lengthening and shortening of syllables, then, is
constantly and naturally practised in the reading of verse which has a
strong lyrical swing such as guides the reader into a sense of its
structure. In verse more subtle and less lyrical in character the
time-intervals are not so strongly marked, and by the ear not trained to
listen for rhythm they are not so easily observed. The five-stress
iambic line, especially when unrimed, has developed far more freedom and
subtlety in English poetry than any other measure, and it is to this
that one finds these writers invariably turning who wish to prove that
our verse is not based on regular time-intervals. A verse like this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The lone couch of his everlasting sleep,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>if read as an ordinary prose phrase, has no obvious metrical character.
The second foot ("couch of") inverts the normal order of accent and
no-accent, and in common speech the second and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span> third syllables would be
long and followed by a phrase-pause, while the fourth and fifth
syllables would be made very short and jointed closely to what follows.
There is no rhythm in such a group of words. But when we know that they
are part of a poem in five-stress verse, we can readjust them so as to
approach more closely to the rhythmical scheme in our minds. We cannot
accent either <i>of</i> or <i>his</i>, without destroying the sense; nor can we
deprive either <i>lone</i> or <i>couch</i> of its accent; but we can <i>lengthen</i>
the words <i>of his</i> beyond their natural time in speech, pronouncing them
more deliberately, and we can also, perhaps, diminish the phrase-pause
after <i>couch</i>. This would tend to equalize the five time-intervals to
which the verse, as a verse, should fit itself. It would be too much to
say that this is what the ordinary reader would do, because the ordinary
reader is likely to have his mind fixed on expressing the sense,
neglecting the rhythm which is equally an element of the poetry; but it
is what the careful reader could do without difficulty.</p>

<p>The first line of <i>Paradise Lost</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>always a favorite specimen for metrists to dissect, is of like
character. Mr. Robertson, in the essay already cited, makes considerable
use of this verse as showing the vanity of the usual method of dividing
verses into equal feet. He quotes approvingly Professor Shairp's account
of the way in which Clough analyzed the line: "The two feet 'first
disobe-' took up the time of four syllables, two iambic feet: the voice
rested awhile on the word 'first'; then passed swiftly over 'diso-,'
then rested again on 'be-' so as to recover the previous hurry." Now
this seems to be merely a description of the way in which the words
would be uttered in prose, and to neglect the rhythm of the poem in
which they stand. In the second foot one can and should give the
syllable <i>dis-</i> full syllabic time, instead of hurrying over it as in
prose speech,&mdash;a rendering made easy by the fact that it frequently has
a marked secondary accent. Conversely, one can give <i>first</i> somewhat
less time than it would occupy in prose, without thereby diminishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
its accent. The word <i>and</i>, in the fourth foot, would in prose utterance
be allowed almost no time-value; and it may be treated in the same way
in the verse, by permitting the pause at the comma to fill up the normal
time of the foot. It would seem to be better, however, to give <i>and</i> a
fairly distinct utterance for metrical purposes (without, of course,
adding any stress), and thus to approach more closely to the scheme of
time-intervals. It is highly improbable that any one would read this
verse&mdash;or almost any other verse of <i>Paradise Lost</i>&mdash;with such exact
observance of the equal time-intervals as would appear in regular
lyrical poetry. We have already seen that blank verse departs more
constantly from the typical scheme of the measure than any other of our
verse-forms. Nevertheless, the reader with a well-trained ear listens
always for the flow of the typical metre underneath the surface
irregularities, and, by a delicate adjustment of syllable-lengths, can
bring the poet's words into far more rhythmical utterance than they
would find in prose.</p>

<p>There is one other method of varying the time-elements in verse which
has already been suggested by what was said of the pause at the comma in
the line of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. It will be seen very generally that light
syllables, such as one wishes to utter in brief periods of time, are
found on either side of the phrase-pauses in our verse.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The first in valor, as the first in place"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is a typical line in this respect. The natural pause, indicated by the
comma, takes up part of the time of the third foot, which there are no
syllables fitted wholly to fill. It might almost be said that, in
ordinary five-stress verse, such verses are quite as numerous as those
with five complete feet. The pause satisfies the ear, so far as the
time-intervals are concerned, quite as well as a long syllable.</p>

<p>Pauses not only fill up the incomplete time of a foot containing only
short syllables, but they also fill the time of wholly missing
syllables. In the verse</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Come from the dying moon, and blow"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we start out with trisyllabic rhythm, but have only two syllables in the
second and in the third foot. It does not seem certain whether the
missing syllable after <i>dying</i> is to have its place filled by a pause or
by a prolongation of either or both of the syllables <i>dy-ing</i>&mdash;perhaps
by all three means combined. In the same way the missing syllable after
<i>moon</i> may have its place filled either by the prolongation of the <i>oo</i>,
or by the pause indicated by the comma, or by both. But in other cases
the pause occupies the entire syllable-moment; for examples, see under
Pauses in pages 20-22 above. The whole matter was well summed up in
Lanier's saying that "rhythm may be dependent on silences" as well as on
sounds.</p>

<p>Let us now try to gather what we have been considering into the form of
definite statements regarding the place of the time-element in our
verse.</p>

<p>1. <i>In the normal verse, accents appear at equal time-intervals.</i> This,
of course, does not preclude all manner of variations; the unit of
measure is not the distance between the accents as they are found in
each verse, but between the points where they belong in the typical
metre.</p>

<p>2. <i>There is a tendency toward the coincidence of long and accented, and
of short and unaccented, syllables.</i> This we have seen to be true in two
different senses. In the first place, an accented syllable is likely to
be lengthened for the same reason that it is accented&mdash;because of its
relative importance in the place where it stands. In the second place,
syllables noticeably long are avoided in those places in the verse where
the accent does not fall, and are preferred where the stress is heavy.</p>

<p>3. <i>In the reading of verse, the length of the syllables is varied
artificially, so as to tend to preserve the equal time-intervals.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>In like manner, pauses are introduced where syllables are short or
wanting, to preserve these intervals.</i></p>

<p>It is quite possible that these laws might be stated more fully and
definitely. In Anglo-Saxon verse the conditions were perhaps not so
different from those of modern English as we are likely to think; there
we know that the principal stresses of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> verse always fell on long
syllables, and scholars like Sievers, by analyzing the remains of our
early poetry, have formulated certain other laws as to the position and
relations of the short syllables. If similar laws were to be formulated
for our modern verse, we should probably find them no more perplexing
than our ancestors would find those we have formulated for their verse.
In every case the "law" is only an attempt to express what the ear has
long known and obeyed. Mr. Goodell, in an article on "Quantity in
English Verse," in the <i>Proceedings of the American Philological
Society</i> for 1885, attempted to do for our verse what has just been
suggested. He stated such laws as these:</p>

<p>"The thesis becomes a triseme if the next syllable bears the ictus. No
syllable can be placed in this position which is incapable of
prolongation."</p>

<p>"If the arsis is monosyllabic, a short vowel in the thesis followed by a
single consonant is not lengthened by the ictus; the arsis is instead
prolonged."</p>

<p>"With arsis monosyllabic, the strong tendency is to make the thesis
short."</p>

<p>Perhaps these rules are on the right track; the terminology is somewhat
difficult, and makes one hesitate to criticise carefully. But since, as
we have seen, the terms "long" and "short," as applied to English
syllables, have come to be so purely relative, since our syllabic
quantities vary so much at the will of the reader, and since the whole
matter of the reading of our verse is in good measure one of subjective
interpretation, it seems very doubtful whether any statements more
explicit than those already laid down would be found of practical
service.</p>

<p>Finally, we come back to the question whether we shall use for English
verse the classical terminology which has for so long been applied to
it. Those who object to such terminology do so either on the ground that
it implies that English accented and unaccented syllables are equivalent
respectively to Latin long and short syllables, or on the still more
fundamental ground that there is nothing in our verse which can properly
be called a "foot." It is undoubtedly true that the use of terms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> based
on quantity has given rise to some confusion when applied to phenomena
based on accent, yet the terms are now understood with as fair a degree
of clearness as any terms relating to so disputed a subject as English
verse; and it seems very doubtful whether it is not easier to explain
them than to introduce new ones. Experiments in the latter direction
have not been very successful. The latest writer on the subject objects,
with considerable severity, to the classical nomenclature "hardly
pressed and barbarously misapplied." Our current prosody, he says later,
"ignores" the frequent occurrence of an accented syllable at the
beginning of a line of Shakspere's verse, "turning it off with the
statement that 'a trochaic foot may begin an iambic verse.'" Yet when we
reach the summary of the author's discussion of the subject, we find the
same phenomenon "turned off" with this statement: "In rising rhythm a
thought-moment may begin with a falling wave-group." One cannot avoid
querying whether this interesting combination of words conveys any
simpler and better idea to the normal English reader than the familiar
statement that "a trochaic foot may begin an iambic verse." The case is
instructive as to the danger of attempting a new terminology where one
is already established, and of imagining that one has thereby made the
discussion of the subject more scientific.</p>

<p>The second of the objections to the usual terminology, that there is no
real <i>foot</i> in English verse, has already been considered. If there are
no regular units of measure in our verse, then to attempt constantly to
find such units, and to use terms that imply their existence, is
certainly a mistake. But those are on the wrong track who would find the
divisions of the verse in the natural phrase-divisions of English
speech.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In "<i>arma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> virumque cano</i>" the syllable <i>vi-</i> is far more
closely connected with the syllable <i>-rum</i>, for all prose purposes, than
with the preceding syllables; but in the verse the Romans thought of it
as being in the same foot with <i>arma</i>; and later in the verse the last
syllable of <i>cano</i> is rhythmically connected (over the barrier of a
comma) with the first of <i>Troj&aelig;</i>. Indeed, the Latin poets instinctively
avoided the regular coincidence of metrical units with word or sentence
units. Precisely the same thing is true of English verse. It has been
suggested more than once that the great preponderance, among English
dissyllables, of those accented on the first syllable, goes to explain
our preference for iambic over trochaic measures; and that one reason
why the rhythm of <i>Hiawatha</i>, for example, so soon wearies the ear, is
because its metrical divisions and word divisions so frequently
coincide. The fundamental principle of verse is that it sets up a new
order of progress which constantly conflicts with, yet without
destroying, the order of progress of common prose speech.</p>

<p>So the <i>foot</i> means, not a unit of measure for the words, but for the
syllables viewed as rhythmical sound; and the attempt has already been
made to show that it represents the time-interval between the regularly
recurring accents of the normal metre. When there are two syllables in
the interval, it is convenient to call the foot an iambus, a trochee, a
pyrrhic, or a spondee; when there are three, it is convenient to call
the foot an anapest or a dactyl. According to this system, the number of
feet in the metre will always depend on the number of regularly
recurring accents, which of course is not the case in classical prosody.
For the same reason, all exceptional feet can be named by one of the six
terms indicated, except where (as in Swinburne's "Choriambics") some
classical metre is deliberately imitated. There is no sufficient reason
for speaking of the choriambus as occurring in Shakspere's verse,
because where four syllables occur in such succession as to form a sort
of choriambus, they will be found to fill the place of <i>two</i> ordinary
feet, not of one; hence it would be irrational to combine them into one
exceptional foot. But on this matter of convenience in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> terminology
of verse, one cannot do better than to refer the reader to Mr. Mayor's
<i>Chapters on English Metre</i>, where a refreshingly simple system is set
forth, such as will not break down under any reasonable test.</p>

<p>There is one defect, it may be freely admitted, in these classical names
of feet. They provide no place for the secondary accent. A foot made up
of a fully accented plus a slightly accented syllable must be called
either a spondee (the second syllable being thought of as approaching
the stress of the first) or a trochee (the syllable being thought of as
approaching no stress). The abundant use of secondary or compromised
accents&mdash;and one might say, too, of secondary or compromised
quantities&mdash;is a Germanic characteristic, for which no classical
terminology can provide. There is, theoretically, room for some new
names of feet recognizing these ambiguous syllables. Yet since degrees
of accent are purely relative, and no two readers would be sure of
agreeing as to which syllables are fully stressed, and which are
half-stressed, it is not likely that such additional terms would make
our terminology any more exact for practical purposes. The present
system does, in fact, represent a characteristic feature of modern
English as distinguished from early English verse; namely, that our
metres strive after a regular alternation of stress and no-stress, and
that the ear imagines this alternation even where (if it were a matter
of prose utterance) it can scarcely be said to exist.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to strive with any warmth for the classical system of
terminology in English prosody. It is undoubtedly not an ideal system,
nor such a one as we should adopt if we were naming everything anew; few
existing terminologies are. The only object of the present defence of
its carefully limited use is to show that it does stand for some
fundamental facts in our verse, and to suggest that it is usually wiser
to make the best of the vocabulary we have than to fly to one we know
not of. The important thing, in any case, is not the question of terms,
but the end that we should not lose hold of the musical rhythms of our
verse, made up of delicately adjusted elements of accent and time.</p>

place too much stress on the element of fixed or natural quantity, and
sometimes to use the terms "long" and "short" with merely traditional
meanings. The most characteristic feature of his discussion is, that he
establishes certain principles of quantity, and judges the poets by
their conformity to these principles. The inductive method is less
pretentious and perhaps safer: to inquire what the poets do, and how in
the reading of their verse we may preserve the rhythm which they
undoubtedly had in mind. Both methods are legitimate. One will lay down
rules for the poet, another for the reader; and there is perhaps as much

Liddell marks the word as one which <i>must</i> be stressed from its

putting <i>where</i> in an unstressed place in the verse, on the ground that
it means "through which." It would perhaps be safe to guess that no
unsophisticated English reader has ever found difficulty in the accents
of the line in question. The matter is worthy of remark as illustrating
the tendency of one class of readers to emphasize <i>sense</i>-reading at the
expense of rhythm. On the other hand, for an illustration of the
opposite extreme see Professor Bright's article on "Grammatical Ictus in
English Verse," in the Furnivall <i>Miscellany</i> (1901), where we are told,
in effect, that the metrical accent must always triumph over the
sense-accent. As usual, the truth seems to lie somewhere between the

<h3>THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The following extracts from important critical discussions are selected
with reference to their bearing on two questions: Is metre an essential
or only an incidental element of poetry? and, What are its functions in
the total content and effect of poetry? The student of the subject will
do well to analyze the answers to the second question, determining under
how many aspects of the metrical element they can be grouped.</p></div>

<p>Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, each of them
lying deep in our nature. First, the instinct of imitation is implanted
in man from childhood.... Next, there is the instinct for harmony and
rhythm, metres being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore,
starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special
aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>: <i>Poetics</i>, iv. Butcher's translation, pp. 15, 17.)</p>


<p>Poetry, music, and dancing constitute in Aristotle a group by
themselves, their common element being imitation by means of
rhythm&mdash;rhythm which admits of being applied to words, sounds, and the
movements of the body. The history of these arts bears out the views we
find expressed in Greek writers upon the theory of music; it is a
witness to the primitive unity of music and poetry, and to the close
alliance of the two with dancing.... The intimate fusion of the three
arts afterward known as the "musical" arts&mdash;or rather we should perhaps
say, the alliance of music and dancing under the supremacy of
poetry&mdash;was exhibited even in the person of the artist. The office of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> poet as teacher of the chorus demanded a practical knowledge of all
that passed under the term "dancing," including steps, gestures,
attitudes, and the varied resources of rhythmical movement.... The poet,
lyric or dramatic, composed the accompaniment as well as wrote the
verses; and it was made a reproach against Euripides, who was the first
to deviate from the established usage, that he sought the aid of Iophon,
son of Sophocles, in the musical setting of his dramas. The very word
"poet" in classical times often implies the twofold character of poet
and musician, and in later writers is sometimes used, like our
"composer," in a strictly limited reference to music.</p>

<p>Aristotle does full justice to the force of rhythmic form and movement
in the arts of music and dancing. The instinctive love of melody and
rhythm is, again, one of the two causes to which he traces the origin of
poetry, but he lays little stress on this element in estimating the
finished products of the poetic art. In the <i>Rhetoric</i> he observes that
if a sentence has metre it will be poetry; but this is said in a popular
way. It was doubtless the received opinion, but it is one which he twice
combats in the <i>Poetics</i>, insisting that it is not metrical form that
makes a poem....</p>

<p>The general question whether metre is necessary for poetical expression
has been raised by many modern critics and poets, and has sometimes been
answered in the negative, as by Sidney, Shelley, Wordsworth. It is,
however, worth observing that from Aristotle's point of view, which was
mainly one of observation, the question to be determined was rather as
to the vehicle or medium of literary <i>mimesis</i>; and so far as the
<i>mimesis</i> doctrine is concerned, it is undeniable that some kinds of
imaginative subject-matter are better expressed in prose, some in verse,
and that Aristotle, who had before him experimental examples of writings
poetic in spirit, but not metrical in form, had sufficient grounds for
advocating an extension of meaning for the term <i>poietes</i>. But as
regards the <i>Art</i> of Poetry, his reasoning does not lead us to conclude
that he would have reckoned the authors of prose dialogues or romances
among poets strictly so called.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span> As Mr. Courthope truly says, "he does
not attempt to prove that metre is not a necessary accompaniment of the
higher conceptions of poetry," and he, "therefore, cannot be ranged with
those who support that extreme opinion." Still there would appear to be
some want of firmness in the position he takes up as to the place and
importance of metre. In his definition of tragedy (chap. vi. 2)
"embellished language" is included among the constituent elements of
tragedy; and the phrase is then explained to mean language that has the
twofold charm of metre (which is a branch of rhythm) and of melody. But
these elements are placed in a subordinate rank and are hardly treated
as essentials. They are in this respect not unlike scenery or
spectacular effect, which, though deduced by Aristotle from the
definition, is not explicitly mentioned in it. The essence of the poetry
is the "imitation"; the melody and the verse are the "seasoning" of the
language.... Aristotle, highly as he rates the &aelig;sthetic capacity of the
sense of hearing in his treatment of music, says nothing to show that he
values at its proper worth the power of rhythmical sound as factor in
poetry; and this is the more striking in a Greek, whose enjoyment of
poetry came through the ear rather than the eye, and for whom poetry was
so largely associated with music. After all, there can hardly be a
greater difference between two ways of saying the same thing than that
one is said in verse, the other in prose. There are some lyrics which
have lived and will always live by their musical charm, and by a strange
magic that lies in the setting of the words. We need not agree with a
certain modern school who would empty all poetry of poetical thought and
etherealize it till it melts into a strain of music; who sing to us we
hardly know of what, but in such a way that the echoes of the real
world, its men and women, its actual stir and conflict, are faint and
hardly to be discerned. The poetry, we are told, resides not in the
ideas conveyed, not in the blending of soul and sense, but in the sound
itself, in the cadence of the verse. Yet, false as this view may be, it
is not perhaps more false than that other which wholly ignores the
effect of musical sound and looks only to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span> thought that is conveyed.
Aristotle comes perilously near this doctrine.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">S. H. Butcher</span>: <i>Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art</i>. pp.
138-147.)</p>


<p>It is not riming and versing that maketh a poet, no more than a long
gown maketh an advocate; who, though he pleaded in armor, should be an
advocate and no soldier. But it is that feigning notable images of
virtues, vices, or what else, with that delightful teaching which must
be the right describing note to know a poet by; although, indeed, the
senate of poets hath chosen verse as their fittest raiment, meaning, as
in matter they passed all in all, so in manner to go beyond them: not
speaking (table-talk fashion, or like men in a dream) words as they
chanceably fell from the mouth, but poyzing each syllable of each word
by just proportion according to the dignity of the subject....</p>

<p>It is already said (and as I think, truly said) it is not riming and
versing that maketh poesy.... But yet, presuppose it were inseparable
(as, indeed, it seemeth Scaliger judgeth) truly it were an inseparable
commendation. For if <i>oratio</i> next to <i>ratio</i>, speech next to reason, be
the greatest gift bestowed upon mortality, that cannot be praiseless,
which doth most polish that blessing of speech, which considers each
word, not only (as a man may say) by his forcible quality, but by his
measured quantity, carrying even in themselves a harmony, without
(perchance) number, measure, order, proportion, be in our time grown
odious. But lay aside the just praise it hath, by being the only fit
speech for music (music, I say, the most divine striker of the senses);
thus much is undoubtedly true, that if reading be foolish, without
remembering, memory being the only treasurer of knowledge, those words
which are fittest for memory are likewise most convenient for knowledge.
Now, that verse far exceedeth prose in the knitting up of the memory,
the reason is manifest. The words (besides their delight, which hath a
great affinity to memory), being so set, as one word cannot be lost, but
the whole work fails, which accuseth itself, calleth the remembrance
back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> to itself, and so most strongly confirmeth it. Besides, one word
so as it were begetting another, as be it in rime or measured verse, by
the former a man shall have a near guess to the follower.... So that,
verse being in itself sweet and orderly, and being best for memory, the
only handle of knowledge, it must be in jest that any man can speak
against it.</p>

<p>Versification, or the art of modulating his numbers, is indispensably
necessary to a poet. Every other power by which the understanding is
enlightened, or the imagination enchanted, may be exercised in prose.
But the poet has this peculiar superiority, that to all the powers which
the perfection of every other composition can require, he adds the
faculty of joining music with reason, and of acting at once upon the
senses and the passions. I suppose there are few who do not feel
themselves touched by poetical melody, and who will not confess that
they are more or less moved by the same thoughts, as they are conveyed
by different sounds, and more affected by the same words in one order
than another. The perception of harmony is, indeed, conferred upon men
in degrees very unequal; but there are none who do not perceive it, or
to whom a regular series of proportionate sounds cannot give delight.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Samuel Johnson</span>: <i>The Rambler</i>, No. 86.)</p>


<p>Various causes might be pointed out why, when the style is manly, and
the subject of some importance, words metrically arranged will long
continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who proves the
extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart. The end of poetry is
to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance of pleasure;
but, by the supposition, excitement is an unusual and irregular state of
the mind; ideas and feelings do not, in that state, succeed each other
in accustomed order.... Now the co-presence of something regular,
something to which the mind has been accustomed in various moods and in
a less excited state, cannot but have great efficacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span> in tempering and
restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling, and of
feeling not strictly and necessarily connected with the passion. This is
unquestionably true; and hence, though the opinion will at first appear
paradoxical, from the tendency of metre to divest language, in a certain
degree, of its reality, and thus to throw a sort of half-consciousness
of unsubstantial existence over the whole composition, there can be
little doubt but that more pathetic situations and sentiments&mdash;that is,
those which have a greater proportion of pain connected with them&mdash;may
be endured in metrical composition, especially in rime, than in
prose.... This opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the
reader's own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the
reperusal of the distressful parts of <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, or the
<i>Gamester</i>; while Shakspere's writings, in the most pathetic scenes,
never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasure&mdash;an effect
which, in a much greater degree than might at first be imagined, is to
be ascribed to small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable
surprise from the metrical arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> On the other hand (what it
must be allowed will much more frequently happen), if the poet's words
should be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate to raise the
reader to a height of desirable excitement, then (unless the poet's
choice of his metre has been grossly injudicious), in the feelings of
pleasure which the reader has been accustomed to connect with metre in
general, and in the feeling, whether cheerful or melancholy, which he
has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre,
there will be found something which will greatly con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>tribute to impart
passion to the words, and to effect the complex end which the poet
proposes to himself.</p>

<p>If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory here maintained,
it would have been my duty to develop the various causes upon which the
pleasure received from metrical language depends. Among the chief of
these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to
those who have made any of the Arts the object of accurate reflection;
namely, the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of
similitude in dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring of the
activity of our minds, and their chief feeder.... It would not be a
useless employment to apply this principle to the consideration of
metre, and to show that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure,
and to point out in what manner that pleasure is produced. But my limits
will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must content myself
with a general summary.</p>

<p>I have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful
feelings; it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity;
the emotion is contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the
tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion, kindred to that which
was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does
itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition
generally begins, and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but
the emotion, of whatever kind, and in whatever degree, from various
causes, is qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any
passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will,
upon the whole, be in a state of enjoyment. If Nature be thus cautious
to preserve in a state of enjoyment a being so employed, the Poet ought
to profit by the lesson held forth to him, and ought especially to take
care that, whatever passions he communicates to his reader, those
passions, if his reader's mind be sound and vigorous, should always be
accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of harmonious
metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind
association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of
rime or metre of the same or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span> similar construction, an indistinct
perception perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of
real life, and yet, in the circumstance of metre, differing from it so
widely&mdash;all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight,
which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling
always found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper
passions. This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned
poetry; while, in lighter compositions, the ease and gracefulness with
which the Poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a
principal source of the gratification of the reader. All that it is
necessary to say, however, upon this subject, may be effected by
affirming, what few persons will deny, that of two descriptions, either
of passions, manners, or characters, each of them equally well executed,
the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse will be read a
hundred times where the prose is read once.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>: Preface to the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, 2d ed.)</p>


<p>The true question must be,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> whether there are not modes of
expression, a construction, and an order of sentences, which are in
their fit and natural place in a serious prose composition, but would be
disproportionate and heterogeneous in metrical poetry; and, <i>vice
versa</i>, whether in the language of a serious poem there may not be an
arrangement both of words and sentences, and a use and selection of
(what are called) figures of speech, both as to their kind, their
frequency, and their occasions, which on a subject of equal weight would
be vicious and alien in correct and manly prose. I contend that in both
cases this unfitness of each for the place of the other frequently will
and ought to exist. And, first, from the origin of metre. This I would
trace to the balance in the mind effected by the spontaneous effort
which strives to hold in check the workings of passion. It might be
easily explained likewise in what manner this salutary antagonism is
assisted by the very state which it counteracts; and how this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> balance
of antagonists became organized into metre (in the usual acceptation of
that term) by a supervening act of the will and judgment, consciously
and for the foreseen purpose of pleasure. Assuming these principles as
the data of our argument, we deduce from them two legitimate conditions,
which the critic is entitled to expect in every metrical work. First,
that as the elements of metre owe their existence to a state of
increased excitement, so the metre itself should be accompanied by the
natural language of excitement. Secondly, that as these elements are
formed into metre artificially, by a voluntary act, with the design and
for the purpose of blending delight with emotion, so the traces of
present volition should throughout the metrical language be
proportionally discernible....</p>

<p>Secondly, I argue from the effects of metre. As far as metre acts in and
for itself, it tends to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of
the general feelings and of the attention. This effect it produces by
the continued excitement of surprise, and by the quick reciprocations of
curiosity still gratified and still re-excited, which are too slight
indeed to be at any moment objects of distinct consciousness, yet become
considerable in their aggregate influence. As a medicated atmosphere, or
as wine during animated conversation, they act powerfully, though
themselves unnoticed. Where, therefore, correspondent food and
appropriate matter are not provided for the attention and feelings thus
roused, there must needs be disappointment felt;&mdash;like that of leaping
in the dark from the last step of a staircase, when we had prepared our
muscles for a leap of three or four.</p>

<p>The discussion on the powers of metre, in the Preface, is highly
ingenious, and touches at all points on truth. But I cannot find any
statement of its powers considered abstractly and separately. On the
contrary, Mr. Wordsworth seems always to estimate metre by the powers
which it exerts during (and, as I think, in consequence of) its
combination with other elements of poetry. Thus the previous difficulty
is left unanswered, what the elements are with which it must be combined
in order to produce its own effects to any pleasurable purpose.... For
any poetic purposes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> metre resembles (if the aptness of the simile may
excuse its meanness) yeast, worthless or disagreeable by itself, but
giving vivacity and spirit to the liquor with which it is proportionally
combined....</p>

<p>Metre in itself is simply a stimulant of the attention, and therefore
excites the question, Why is the attention to be thus stimulated? Now
the question cannot be answered by the pleasure of the metre itself; for
this we have shown to be conditional, and dependent on the
appropriateness of the thoughts and expressions to which the metrical
form is superadded. Neither can I conceive any other answer that can be
rationally given, short of this: I write in metre, because I am about to
use a language different from that of prose....</p>

<p>Thirdly, I deduce the position from all the causes elsewhere assigned
which render metre the proper form of poetry, and poetry imperfect and
defective without metre. Metre, therefore, having been connected with
poetry most often, and by a peculiar fitness, whatever else is combined
with metre must, though it be not itself essentially poetic, have
nevertheless some property in common with poetry, as an intermedium of
affinity.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>: <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, chap. xviii.)</p>


<p>In the youth of the world, men dance and sing and imitate natural
objects, observing in these actions, as in all others, a certain rhythm
or order. And, although all men observe a similar, they observe not the
same order, in the motions of the dance, in the melody of the song, in
the combinations of language, in the series of their imitations of
natural objects. For there is a certain order or rhythm belonging to
each of these classes of mimetic representation, from which the hearer
and the spectator receive an intenser and purer pleasure than from any
other: the sense of an approximation to this order has been called taste
by modern writers....</p>

<p>Language, color, form, and religious and civil habits of action are all
the instruments and materials of poetry; and they may be called poetry
by that figure of speech which considers the effect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> as a synonym of the
cause. But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses those
arrangements of language, and especially metrical language, which are
created by that imperial faculty whose throne is curtained within the
invisible nature of man. And this springs from the nature itself of
language, which is a more direct representation of the actions and
passions of our internal being, and is susceptible of more various and
delicate combinations than color, form, or motion, and is more plastic
and obedient to the control of that faculty of which it is the
creation.... Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between each
other and towards that which they represent, and a perception of the
order of those relations has always been found connected with a
perception of the order of the relations of thoughts. Hence the language
of poets has ever affected a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence
of sound, without which it were not poetry, and which is scarcely less
indispensable to the communication of its influence than the words
themselves, without reference to that peculiar order.... An observation
of the regular mode of the recurrence of harmony in the language of
poetical minds, together with its relation to music, produced metre, or
a certain system of traditional forms of harmony and language. Yet it is
by no means essential that a poet should accommodate his language to
this traditional form, so that the harmony, which is its spirit, be
observed.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Shelley</span>: <i>A Defence of Poetry</i>.)</p>


<p>Poetry, in its matter and form, is natural imagery or feeling, combined
with passion and fancy. In its mode of conveyance, it combines the
ordinary use of language with musical expression. There is a question of
long standing in what the essence of poetry consists, or what it is that
determines why one set of ideas should be expressed in prose, another in
verse. Milton has told us his idea of poetry in a single line:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Thoughts that voluntary move<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Harmonious numbers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As there are certain sounds that excite certain movements, and the song
and dance go together, so there are, no doubt, certain thoughts that
lead to certain tones of voice, or modulations of sound, and change "the
words of Mercury into the songs of Apollo." ... The jerks, the breaks,
the inequalities and harshnesses of prose are fatal to the flow of a
poetical imagination, as a jolting road or a stumbling horse disturbs
the reverie of an absent man. But poetry "makes these odds all even." It
is the music of language, answering to the music of the mind, untying,
as it were, "the secret soul of harmony." Wherever any object takes such
a hold of the mind as to make us dwell upon it, and brood over it,
melting the heart in tenderness, or kindling it to a sentiment of
enthusiasm; wherever a movement of imagination or passion is impressed
on the mind, by which it seeks to prolong and repeat the emotion, to
bring all other objects into accord with it, and to give the same
movement of harmony, sustained and continuous, or gradually varied,
according to the occasion, to the sounds that express it&mdash;this is
poetry. The musical in sound is the sustained and continuous; the
musical in thought is the sustained and continuous also. There is a near
connection between music and deep-rooted passion. Mad people sing. As
often as articulation passes naturally into intonation, there poetry
begins.... It is to supply the inherent defect of harmony in the
customary mechanism of language, to make the sound an echo to the sense,
when the sense becomes a sort of echo to itself&mdash;to mingle the tide of
verse, "the golden cadences of poetry," with the tide of feeling,
flowing and murmuring as it flows&mdash;in short, to take the language of the
imagination from off the ground; and enable it to spread its wings where
it may indulge its own impulses:</p>

<p>without being stopped, or fretted, or diverted with the abruptnesses and
petty obstacles, and discordant flats and sharps of prose, that poetry
was invented. It is to common language what springs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> are to a carriage,
or wings to feet. In ordinary speech we arrive at a certain harmony by
the modulations of the voice; in poetry the same thing is done
systematically by a regular collocation of syllables. It has been well
observed, that every one who declaims warmly, or grows intent upon a
subject, rises into a sort of blank verse or measured prose.... An
excuse might be made for rime in the same manner. It is but fair that
the ear should linger on the sounds that delight it, or avail itself of
the same brilliant coincidence and unexpected recurrence of syllables,
that have been displayed in the invention and collocation of images. It
is allowed that rime assists the memory.... But if the jingle of names
assists the memory, may it not also quicken the fancy?</p>

<p>With regard to the principle of Variety in Uniformity by which verses
ought to be modulated, and oneness of impression diversely produced, it
has been contended by some that poetry need not be written in verse at
all; that prose is as good a medium, provided poetry be conveyed through
it, and that to think otherwise is to confound letter with spirit, or
form with essence. But the opinion is a prosaical mistake. Fitness and
unfitness for <i>song</i>, or metrical excitement, just make all the
difference between a poetical and prosaical subject; and the reason why
verse is necessary to the form of poetry is that the perfection of
poetical spirit demands it&mdash;that the circle of its enthusiasm, beauty,
and power is incomplete without it. I do not mean that a poet can never
show himself a poet in prose; but that being one, his desire and
necessity will be to write in verse; and that, if he were unable to do
so, he would not and could not deserve his title. Verse to the true poet
is no clog. It is idly called a trammel and a difficulty. It is a help.
It springs from the same enthusiasm as the rest of his impulses, and is
necessary to their satisfaction and effect.... Verse is the final proof
to the poet that his mastery over his art is complete. It is the
shutting up of his powers in "<i>measureful</i> content"; the answer of form
to his spirit; of strength and ease to his guidance.... Verse, in short,
is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span> that finishing, and rounding, and "tuneful planeting" of the poet's
creations which is produced of necessity by the smooth tendencies of
their energy or inward working, and the harmonious dance into which they
are attracted round the orb of the beautiful. Poetry, in its complete
sympathy with beauty, must of necessity leave no sense of the beautiful,
and no power over its forms, unmanifested; and verse flows as inevitably
from this condition of its integrity as other laws of proportion do from
any other kind of embodiment of beauty....</p>

<p>Every poet, then, is a versifier; every fine poet an excellent one; and
he is the best whose verse exhibits the greatest amount of strength,
sweetness, straightforwardness, unsuperfluousness, variety, and
oneness;&mdash;oneness, that is to say, consistency in the general
impression, metrical and moral; and variety, or every pertinent
diversity of tone and rhythm, in the process.... It is thus that
versification itself becomes part of the sentiment of a poem, and
vindicates the pains that have been taken to show its importance. I know
of no very fine versification unaccompanied with fine poetry; no poetry
of a mean order accompanied with verse of the highest.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Leigh Hunt</span>: <i>What is Poetry?</i> Cook ed., pp. 37-40, 61.)</p>


<p>No literary expression can, properly speaking, be called poetry that is
not in a certain deep sense emotional, whatever may be its
subject-matter, concrete in its method and its diction, rhythmical in
movement, and artistic in form.... That poetry must be metrical or even
rhythmical in movement, however, is what some have denied. Here we touch
at once the very root of the subject.... While prose requires
intellectual life and emotional life, poetry seems to require not only
intellectual life and emotional life but rhythmic life.... Unless the
rhythm of any metrical passage is so vigorous, so natural, and so free
that it seems as though it could live, if need were, by its rhythm
alone, has that passage any right to exist? and should it not, if the
substance is good, be forthwith demetricized and turned into prose? ...
Aristotle ignored, and Plato slighted, the importance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span> versification
(though Plato on one occasion admitted that he who did not know rhythm
could be called neither musician nor poet).... On the whole, however,
the theory that versification is not an indispensable requisite of a
poem seems to have become nearly obsolete in our time. Perhaps, indeed,
many critics would now go so far in the contrary direction as to say
with Hegel (<i>&AElig;sthetik</i>, iii. p. 289) that "metre is the first and only
condition absolutely demanded by poetry, yea even more necessary than a
figurative picturesque diction."</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">Theodore Watts</span>: Article on "Poetry" in <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>.)</p>


<p>Verse-rhythm in words is the imposition of a <i>sensible</i> order on what
naturally and normally has only a <i>logical</i> order; and there is piquancy
in the feeling that so little is this ideal control a fettering
instrument, that each order seems to gain verve and spontaneity from the
other, or rather from the latent sense that the other, though present
and operative, is powerless to hamper it. Much more important, however,
is it to notice how the sense that one single thing&mdash;the word-series&mdash;is
lending itself to this joint dominance may take the form of a sort of
transfigured surprise. (The root-principle here involved is the old one
of "unity in variety," the <i>single</i> line of words, "dominated at once by
the idea which they express in their grammatical connection and by their
metrical adjustment," clearly possessing <i>two</i> independent functions or
aspects. See the fuller discussion of "The Sound-element in Verse," in
chapter xix. of <i>The Power of Sound</i>.) ... When, as in verse, the sounds
are pointedly addressed <i>both</i> to the ear and to the understanding, the
rarity of the combination of aspects contributes a strain of feeling
partly akin to that with which we follow an exhibition of skill, and
partly to that with which we receive an unexpected gratuity....</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Rhythm perpetually not only transfigures the poetical
expression of an idea, but makes the existence of that expression
possible. This is tolerably obvious in the case of what is often called
<i>par excellence</i> poetical language&mdash;language which keeps clear of
prosaic homeliness and prosaic precision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span> and of technical and abstract
terms, and confines itself to a more picturesque and loftier
vocabulary.... Clearly it is the rarity of rhythmic, as compared with
non-rhythmic, speech that supports such rarity of poetic as compared
with non-poetic diction; that is to say, verse, being in one
respect&mdash;namely, its effect on the ear&mdash;a marked exception from ordinary
language, thereby establishes for itself the means of being exceptional,
without seeming unnatural, in other ways....</p>

<p>... In dwelling on the non-reasonable part in poetical beauty, I am in
no way committed to the assertion that all its constituents are excluded
from prose, but only to the assertion that the metrical form makes a
difference of kind. It cannot be for nothing that the very idea of
"poetical prose" inspires dread; and the instances of prose-writing
where we find delight of the intangible and non-reasonable kind are
exceptions that only prove the rule. One has but to test by
self-examination the living force of words in a specimen of verse and of
poetical prose which may respectively seem to oneself first-rate of
their kind. For such typical passages may often be regarded as fairly on
a par in respect of the ideas and emotions which they reasonably
express; and the prose may unquestionably further resemble the poetry in
a certain subtle individuality of life in its more prominent words, so
far as this life can be quickened in them by the idea itself, aided by
such qualities of sound-arrangement as are possible apart from metre. So
far the poetical merits of the respective passages may be equal; yet
only one of them is Poetry.... Language, which in prose does little more
than transmit thought, like clear glass, becomes&mdash;even as that
becomes&mdash;by art's adjustments and the moulding of measured form, a lens,
where the thought takes fire as it passes. The poet speaks through a
medium which seems to intensify the point and to extend the range of
what he would tell us by some power outside his own volition. Such a
power, in fact, a rhythmic order, in its fundamental appeal to human
nerves, literally is.... The <i>ictus</i> of the verse comes upon us as the
operative force which shocks the words into their unwonted life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>... In considering the total contribution of metre to imaginative
language, it is impossible to overlook the quality of <i>permanence</i>. I do
not mean permanence merely in the sense that metrical words live in the
memory.... This is, of course, a most important fact; but I am here
dealing only with elements of effect that enter into the actual moment
of enjoyment.... It is a sense of combined parts, and their
indispensableness one to another, which gives us a sense of permanence
in an arch as compared with a casual heap of stones; it is a similar
indispensableness which gives to metrical language an air of permanence
impossible even to the most harmonious sentence whose sounds conform to
no genuine scheme. And again, in the case of this constituent as of the
others, we have no difficulty in seeing that its influence is really a
joint one of sound and sense&mdash;that, though founded in the nature of
metrical sound as such, it is not merely a sound-quality superposed <i>ab
extra</i> on the intelligible beauty of the words, but depends for its
existence on their intelligible character.... We cannot glory in the
enshrining for memory of things that we do not care to remember. But for
that which is of true spiritual significance the fairly-fitted body of
sound is greeted as the inevitable investiture; and thus justified and
quickened, the strength of the mutually indispensable parts seems no
longer that of mere structure but of organic life.</p>

<p>Why have poets always written in metre? The answer is, Because the laws
of artistic expression oblige them to do so. When the poet has been
inspired from without in the way in which we saw Scott was inspired to
conceive the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>&mdash;that is to say, when he has
found his subject-matter in an idea, universally striking to the
imagination, when he has received this into his own imagination, and has
given it a new and beautiful form of life there, then he will seek to
express his conception through a vehicle of language harmonizing with
his own feelings and the nature of the subject, and this kind of
language is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span> verse. For example, when Marlowe wishes to represent
the emotions of Faustus, after he has called up the phantom of Helen of
Troy, it is plain that some very rapturous form of expression is needed
to convey an adequate idea of such famous beauty. Marlowe rises to the
occasion in those "mighty lines" of his:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And burned the topless towers of Ilium?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it is certain that he could only have ventured on the sublime
audacity of saying that a face launched ships and burned towers by
escaping from the limits of ordinary language, and conveying his
metaphor through the harmonious and ecstatic movements of rhythm and
metre....</p>

<p>I think Wordsworth's analysis of emotion is clearly wrong. The reason
why the harrowing descriptions of Richardson are simply painful, while
Shakspere's tragic situations are pleasurable, is that the imagination
shrinks from dwelling on ideas so closely imitated from real objects as
the scenes in <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, but contemplates without excess of
pain the situation in <i>Othello</i>, for example, because the imitation is
poetical and ideal. Prose is used by Richardson because his novel
professedly resembles a situation of real life; metre is needed by
Shakspere to make the ideal life of his drama real to the imagination.
Wordsworth, if I may say so, has put the poetical cart before the
horse....</p>

<p>The propriety of poetical expression is the test and the touch-stone of
the justice of poetical conception.... Poetry lies in the invention of
the right metrical form&mdash;be it epic, dramatic, lyric, or satiric&mdash;for
the expression of some idea universally interesting to the imagination.
When the form of metrical expression seems <i>natural</i>&mdash;natural, that is,
to the genius of the poet and the inherent character of the
subject&mdash;then the subject-matter will have been rightly conceived....
Apply this test of what is natural in metrical expression to any
composition claiming to be poetically inspired, and you will be able to
decide whether it fulfils the universal conditions of poetical life, or
whether it is one of those phantoms, or, as Bacon calls them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span> idols of
the imagination, which vanish as soon as the novelty of their appearance
has exhausted its effect. For instance, the American poet, Walt Whitman,
announces his theme, and asks for the sympathy of the reader in these
words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Oneself I sing, a simple, separate person,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En Masse.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poets to come, orators, singers, musicians to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than<br /></span>
<span class="i6">before known,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Arouse! for you must justify me!..."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this appeal I think the reader may reply: The subject you have chosen
is certainly an idol of the imagination. For if you had anything of
universal interest to say about yourself, you could say it in a way
natural to one of the metres, or metrical movements, established in the
English language. What you call metre bears precisely the same relation
to these universal laws of expression, as the Mormon church and the
religion of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young bear to the doctrines of
Catholic Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>Why do we so often find men in these days, either using metre ... where
they ought to have expressed themselves in prose, or expressing
themselves in verse in a style so far remote from the standard of
diction established in society that they fail to touch the heart? I
think the explanation of this curious phenomenon is that, though metre
can only properly be used for the expression of universal ideas, there
is in modern society an eccentric or monastic principle at work, which
leads men to pervert metre into a luxurious instrument for the
expression of merely private ideas.</p>

<p class="attrib">(<span class="smcap">William John Courthope</span>: <i>Life in Poetry, Law in Taste</i>, pp. 71-83.)</p>


<p>Language is colloquial and declarative in our ordinary speech, and on
its legs for common use and movement. Only when it takes wings does it
become poetry. As the poet, touched by emotion, rises to enthusiasm and
imaginative power or skill, his speech grows <i>rhythmic</i>, and thus puts
on the attribute that distinguishes it from every other mode of artistic
expression&mdash;the guild-mark which, rightly considered, establishes the
nature of the thing itself.... Our new empiricism, following where
intuition leads the way, comprehends the function of <i>vibrations</i>: it
perceives that every movement of matter, seized upon by universal force,
is <i>vibratory</i>; that vibrations, and nothing else, convey through the
body the look and voice of nature to the soul; that thus alone can one
incarnate individuality address its fellow; that, to use old Bunyan's
imagery, these vibrations knock at the ear-gate, and are visible to the
eye-gate, and are sentient at the gates of touch of the living temple.
The word describing their action is in evidence; they "thrill" the body,
they thrill the soul, both of which respond with subjective,
interblending vibrations, according to the keys, the wave-lengths, of
their excitants. Thus it is absolutely true that what Buxton Forman
calls "idealized language,"&mdash;that is, speech which is imaginative and
rhythmical,&mdash;goes with emotional thought; and that words exert a
mysterious and potent influence, thus chosen and assorted, beyond their
normal meanings....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>Aside from the vibratory mission of rhythm, its little staff of
adjuvants, by the very discipline and limitations which they impose,
take poetry out of the plane of common speech, and make it an art which
lifts the hearer to its own unusual key. Schiller writes to Goethe that
"rhythm, in a dramatic work, treats all characters and all situations
according to one law.... In this manner it forms the atmosphere for the
poetic creation. The more material part is left out, for only what is
spiritual can be borne by this thin element." In real, that is,
spontaneous minstrelsy, the fittest assonance, consonance, time, even
rime, ... come of themselves with the imaginative thought.... Such is
the test of genuineness, the underlying principle being that the
masterful words of all poetic tongues are for the most part in both
their open and consonantal sounds related to their meanings, so that
with the inarticulate rhythm of impassioned thought we have a
correspondent verbal rhythm for its vehicle. The whole range of poetry
which is vital, from the Hebrew psalms and prophecies, in their original
text and in our great English version, to the Georgian lyrics and
romances and the Victorian idyls, confirms the statement of Mill that
"the deeper the feeling, the more characteristic and decided the
rhythm." The rapture of the poet governs the tone and accent of his</p>

<span class="i2">To their own music chanted."<br /></span>

<p>We agree, then, to call by the name of poetry that form of art which
uses rhythm to attain its ends, just as we call by the name of flying
that motion which certain animals attain by the use of wings; that the
feelings roused by poetry can be roused by unrhythmic order of words,
and that rhythmic order of words is often deplorably bad art, or
"unpoetic," have as little to do with the case as the fact that a
greyhound speeding over the grass gives the spectator quite the
exhilaration and sense of lightness and grace which is roused by the
flight of a bird, and the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span> that an awkward fowl makes itself
ridiculous in trying to fly, have to do with the general proposition
that flying is a matter of wings.... As a matter of fact, all writers on
poetry take rhythm for granted until some one asks why it is necessary;
whereupon considerable discussion, and the protest signed by a
respectable minority, but a minority after all, that rhythm is not an
essential condition of the poetic art. This discussion, as every one
knows, has been lively and at times bitter. A patient and comprehensive
review of it in a fairly impartial spirit has led to the conclusion,
first, that no test save rhythm has been proposed which can be put to
real use, even in theory, not to mention the long reaches of a
historical and comparative study; secondly, that all defenders of the
poem in prose are more or less contradictory and inconsistent, making
confusion between theory and practice; and thirdly, that advocates of a
rhythmic test, even in abstract definition, seem to have the better of
the argument....</p>

<p>All reports of primitive singing, that is, of singing among races on a
low plane of culture, make rhythm a wholly insistent element of the
verse.... Rhythm is obscured or hidden by declamation only in times when
the eye has usurped the functions of the ear, and when a highly
developed prose makes the accented rhythm of poetry seem either
old-fashioned or a sign of childhood. Not that one wishes to restore a
sing-song reading, but rather a recognition of metrical structure, of
those subtle effects in rhythm which mean so much in the poet's art;
verse, in a word, particularly lyric verse, must not be read as if it
were prose. Dramatic verse is a difficult problem.... For in drama one
wishes nowadays to hear not rhythm, but the thought, the story, the
point.... As thought recedes, as one comes nearer to those primitive
emotions which were untroubled by thought, they get expression more and
more in cadenced tones. And again, this cadenced emotional expression,
as it grows stronger, grows wider; the barriers of irony and reserve,
which keep a modern theatre tearless in the face of Lear's most pathetic
utterance, break down; first, as one recedes from modern conditions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
comes the sympathetic emotion of the spectators expressed in sighs and
tears; ... then comes the partial activity of the spectators by their
deputed chorus; and at last the throng of primitive times, common
emotion in common expression, with no spectators, no audience, no
reserve or comment of thought,&mdash;for thought is absorbed in the
perception and action of communal consent; and here, by all evidence,
rhythm rules supreme....</p>

<p>If, now, the curve of evolution in Aryan verse begins with an absolutely
strict rhythm and alternate emphasis of syllables, often, as in Iranian,
to the neglect of logical considerations; if the course of poetry is to
admit logical considerations more and more, forcing in at least one case
the abandoning of movable accent and the agreement of verse-emphasis
with syllabic-emphasis, an undisputed fact; if poetry, too, first shakes
off the steps of dancing, then the notes of song, finally the strict
scanning of the verse, until now recited poetry is triumphantly logical,
with rhythm as a subconscious element; if, finally, this process exactly
agrees with the gradual increase of thought over emotion, with the
analogous increase of solitary poetry over gregarious poetry,&mdash;then,
surely, one has but to trace back this curve of evolution, and to
project it into prehistoric conditions, in order to infer with something
very close to certitude that rhythm is the primal fact in the beginnings
of the poetic art....</p>

<p>The hold of rhythm upon modern poetry, even under conditions of analytic
and intellectual development which have unquestionably worked for the
increased importance of prose, is a hold not to be relaxed, and for good
reason. The reason is this. In rhythm, in sounds of the human voice,
timed to movements of the human body, mankind first discovered that
social consent which brought the great joys and the great pains of life
into a common utterance.... The mere fact of utterance is social;
however solitary his thought, a poet's utterance must voice this consent
of man with man, and his emotion must fall into rhythm, the one and
eternal expression of consent. This, then, is why rhythm will not be
banished from poetry so long as poetry shall remain emotional utterance;
for rhythm is not only sign and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> warrant of a social contract stronger,
deeper, vaster, than any fancied by Rousseau, but it is the expression
of a human sense more keen even than the fear of devils and the love of
gods&mdash;the sense and sympathy of kind.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

B&uuml;cher's essay on "Labor and Rhythm" (<i>Arbeit und Rhythmus</i>, Leipzig,
1896): "Fatigue, which besets all work felt as work by reason of its
continued application of purpose, vanished for primitive man, as it
vanishes now for children, if the work was once freed from this stress
of application and so turned to a kind of play. The dance itself is
really hard work, exacting and violent; what makes it the favorite it is
with savages as with children? Simply its automatic, regular, rhythmic
character, the due repetition of a familiar movement which allows the
mind to relax its attitude of constant purpose. The purpose and plan of
work involve external sources and external ends; rhythm is instinctive,
and springs from the organic nature of man; it is no invention. The song
that one sings while at work is not something fitted to the work, but
comes from movements of the body in the specific acts of labor; and this
applies not only to the rhythm, but even to the words. So it was in the
festal dance.... That poetry and music were always combined by early
man, and, along with labor, made up the primitive three-in-one, an
organic whole, labor being the basal fact, with rhythm as an element
common to the three; and that not harmony or pitch, but this
overmastering and pervasive rhythm, exact, definite, was the main factor
of early song,&mdash;these are conclusions for which B&uuml;cher offers ample and
convincing evidence." (<i>Ib.</i> pp. 108, 109.)</p></div>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3>TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET</h3>


<p>The following table is designed, in the first place, to illustrate the
history of the decasyllabic couplet in English verse, by making possible
a comparison of the characteristic details of its form in different
periods; and, in the second place, to suggest a method by which, through
the careful tabulation of facts, one may substantiate or correct general
statements as to the qualities of verse.</p>

<p>Any such statistics as are here presented must be accepted, if at all,
with no little caution. The table is based on passages of one hundred
lines each, believed to be fairly representative of the verse of the
several authors. No passage of this length, however, can be known to be
perfectly typical. A still greater difficulty is found in the
necessarily subjective character of any such tabulation. Most lines of
English decasyllabic verse can be read&mdash;with reference to the
distribution of accents and pauses&mdash;in more than one way. It is
unlikely, therefore, that any two readers would reach the same results
in trying to form a table of this kind. The <i>absolute</i> validity of the
figures is therefore doubtful; but on condition that they all have been
computed by the same person, consistently with a single standard of
judgment, their relative validity, for purposes of <i>comparison</i>, may be
fairly assumed.</p>

<p>The facts here set down for each specimen of verse group themselves in
four divisions. In the first place, each line of verse is either
"run-on" or "end-stopped"; and, in riming couplets, it is also of
interest to know whether the second line of the couplet is run-on into
the following couplet. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> the second place, the cesural pause occurs
either near the middle of the line or elsewhere, or&mdash;it may be&mdash;is
omitted altogether. In the third place, the line may have a feminine
ending. In the fourth place, it may contain some other foot than the
regular iambus.</p>

<p>There is some room for difference of judgment as to whether a given line
is "end-stopped" or "run-on"; but with occasional exceptions the
presence or want of a mark of punctuation may be made the determining
element. Obviously one may find such clear phrase-pauses, without
punctuation, as will justify the caption "end-stopped."</p>

<p>There is far more divergence of judgment in the recognition of the
cesura. Some writers on prosody treat practically every line of ten
syllables as having a cesural pause, and certainly some slight
phrase-pause may almost always be found. In the following table,
however, the cesura has been recognized only when there is a grammatical
or rhetorical pause so considerable as&mdash;in most cases&mdash;to require a mark
of punctuation. Such a verse, then, as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is counted as having "no cesura." The cesura is counted as "medial" when
occurring after the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllable; elsewhere it is
regarded as "variant." The significance of this distinction is very
clear in the comparison of the heroic couplet of the "classical" with
that of the "romantic" school of poets.<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>It is in the last group of facts, those relating to substituted feet,
that the subjective element is most embarrassing. There can be no very
general agreement among readers as to the degree of accent necessary to
change a pair of syllables from an "iambus" to a "pyrrhic" or a
"spondee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span> The other two forms of substitution (inverted accent, giving
"trochees," and trisyllabic feet, giving "anapests") are somewhat more
definitely determinable. In the following table the naming of all these
feet is based on what is believed to be the natural reading of the
verse, with a due regard for both rhetorical and metrical accent. In the
verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"By these the springs of property were bent"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the fourth foot is counted a pyrrhic; so also in this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>although here a certain secondary accent on the eighth syllable is
possible. In such a verse as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"There is a path on the sea's azure floor"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the third foot is counted a pyrrhic and the fourth a spondee.<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>One may get, then, from a table of this sort, a general view of the
character of any particular piece of verse, in respect to the poet's
preference for run-on lines, for feminine endings, for breaking the
verse into two equal parts, for varying the cesura, or for substituting
exceptional feet. The description would be more nearly complete if there
were also indicated the <i>places</i> in the verse where substituted feet
occur; a trochee in the second foot is a very different thing from one
in the first; but it is difficult to tabulate facts of this order
without complicating one's results beyond the point of serviceable
clearness.</p>

<p>Some students of verse are doubtless offended by the use of statistics
in connection with a subject of this kind; and it is easy to ridicule
the obvious incongruity of mathematical methods and poetry. A recent
magazine critic makes merry over certain statistical studies in rhythm,
carried on in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span> laboratory by recording the beats in nursery-rimes on
the one hand and in hymns on the other. "There is a certain class of
problems," he observes most justly, "whose external aspects may possibly
yield to statistical tabulation, but which in the last resort must be
spiritually discerned."<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Poetry is unquestionably of this class. Yet
this would not seem to forbid the study, by scientific methods, of those
"external aspects" admittedly susceptible of tabulation. One is not
likely to recommend elementary students to count trochees and cesuras in
order to increase their appreciation of good verse. But when one comes
to the point of generalizing as to the laws or history of verse-forms,
it is well to have a method of correction, representable in figures
black and white, for the vague impressions which are all that
appreciative reading can give. Perhaps the real service of such a method
as has just been described is to prevent one from making hasty
generalizations which statistics will not support.</p>

<p>Obviously the same system can be applied to blank verse, with the
omission of the second category in the table. A convenient method of
making such a study is to use sheets of paper ruled for twenty-five
lines and seven columns. Each horizontal line represents a line of verse
analyzed. The columns are headed "Cesura," "T," "P," "S," "A," "Run-on,"
and "Fem. Ending." A cesural pause between the third and fourth
syllables is indicated by the figures 3/4 in the first column. A trochee
in the first foot is indicated by the figure 1 in the "T" column; a
spondee in the fourth foot by the figure 4 in the "S" column; and so on.
A simple check-mark in the sixth or seventh column indicates
respectively a case of <i>enjambement</i> or of feminine ending. When the
tabulation is complete, one can easily note the proportion of run-on
lines and exceptional cesuras, and can also determine at a glance not
only the number of exceptional feet but the parts of the verse in which
they occur.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_61" id="Footnote_60_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_61"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> Here a word of caution is needed. It will be observed that
the regularly balanced line of the classical couplet requires not only a
medial pause, but also a pause at the end. Hence where we find, as in
the verse of Keats, a large number of medial cesuras but at the same
time a very large number of "run-on" lines, the characteristic effect of
the medial pause is almost entirely lost, and the number of medial
pauses is not significant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_62" id="Footnote_61_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_62"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> This combination (of pyrrhic and spondee) is of course
very frequent; and where both substitutions occur together, the general
average of accents is maintained, only with exchange of position. On the
other hand, where there appears a large number of pyrrhics with almost
no spondees (as in the case of Dryden), a different sort of verse is
indicated,&mdash;one where the lines gain a certain lightness and rapidity
from the lack of the full number of fully accented syllables.</p></div>
